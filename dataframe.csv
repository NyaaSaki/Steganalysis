Shadowy fields that are scentless but full of singing, 
Never a bird, but the passionless chant of insects, ; Ceaseless, insistent.

Under a moon waning and worn, broken, ; Tired with summer.

Weeds in the moonlight, fields that are tangled with asters, 
Let me remember, soon will the winter be on us, ;Snow-hushed and heavy.

While I gaze, O fields that rest after harvest,
As those who part look long in the eyes they lean to, ; Lest they forget them.",False

How oft in schoolboy-days, from the school’s sway
Have I run forth to Nature as to a friend,—
With some pretext of o’erwrought sight, to spend
My school-time in green meadows far away!
Careless of summoning bell, or clocks that strike,
I marked with flowers the minutes of my day:
For still the eye that shrank from hated hours,
Dazzled with decimal and dividend,
Knew each bleached alder-root that plashed across
The bubbling brook, and every mass of moss;
Could tell the month, too, by the vervain-spike,—
How far the ring of purple tiny flowers
Had climbed; just starting, may-be, with the May,
Half-light, or tapering off at Summer’s end.",False
