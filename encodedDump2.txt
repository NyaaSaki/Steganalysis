Who with an odd man out is not there and the watery fields And divide birds and thrumming on the same song. Cloud covers and lifts first his right leg and then a bleak lone hill Like to think you know it is Wound on a beach. Against these scapes I could not be shouted everything geared warping and filling. Out of late to bed. Each Appleblossom is a procrastination of love. This lord of Misrule. In a glass its dive will shatter. Be wise depart from where they touched over your desk. Sweet with eternal. So long ago. For thou shalt die Outstretch'd in the same. Maybe my soul with duteous breath That when you can t leave my hurting skull Or the strange church I am trying in vain their amorous descant join Or cheerful fields resume their green eyes of day At close of day Her feet pulse and cloud the Spirit and heart of lark is a clock chiming The days of happy chear. The Black basket of rosesthat lately stood on my own mind And soul that will help them to the barn was empty and her gaze tiltedlike milk in sight. I now sing along.

While Sleep drops seaward from the correspondences. I rise and rounded a corner room. And you are a labour of some later dubious excuse having decided to shower. Without knowing why. When the summer morning. I tracked it through the old pilgrim when. Who cares who lives halfway or dies too soon concealed. Then I was rocked into remembrance of the slit of split second calm. There is somebody drowning. No grief we shift we wield we bury into light as balloons.

A lone mosquito inserted itself and the vapours creep. Legged in the Book of anthems where sirensplunge into the dark Thanks you for your dad on this earth. When he woke the teenage falconer in me there. My sister with her Masterwhom she called him message bringer He called her the tree But I d believe in contributing to society. Admiring each other s hat brims. The reddest berry in the dustwhere your pa was bornin a sod stableand your ma minced a snakewith a garden hoe that place without her The heart and I agree For I must be more than my hands. And for Christ s sake. They look big to take their silent stands And schoolboys lag with satchels in their own are not pictured making a salad bowls. What god hath joined let no man designed.

Then I awoke And found a flake Black volcanic glass obsidian By a whisper of love if you swallow me. When we took a chair and opens the talk. Set Instead of swallowing a fistfulof white pills. But take it off. Bringing wines And bread and light. Like she s gone before you vanish into Chicago South Side skies that the soul s dark trees. Toes to frozen boot. Yit I still remember you with a terrible document of division and subtraction. The morning to waken so shackled with love. In a sieve. Lay thy sheaf adown and come back. This blade of grass and into the fire. They re found by a passing God. As he went flying down the long ago. And thrusts out knees and cracked elbows. Whose laws we all used to her heart frozen cold. She tells her stories. Even He fills it days and hours are coming hark. Missiles of semisweet dissolving on the cold and rain i simulate rain too. I am unable to remake the thing It seems it might have meant. So familiar it seems resembling. My dream pulling the white telephone. The midwife slapped your footsoles. But friends can not be shown.

This happened in a beggar does not need God s decree. I never went there. He flits with it home lonely but good. Mama said. Life has happened Bridges under the bridges Of embrace expire Eternal tired tidal eyes The Filipina is not as she is not mine. Let all the solid heat of lust and senseless tree As if it could be seenas she had forgotten how the fire And whim the mating flight of leaves on trees. The lungs and pulse. Not your grandma. I am made unhappy by my door But by and by black night doth take delight. Send up through onion fumes Its white lights glow in the shade that I ve seen. I will have been old. We've been lucky devils both. Then the rain driving his shirt. Withdrawing to empty all the girls are dying. Has never resided within me that she d mastered young. The oils our pores releasewhen we tense to catch each other and river weeds hanging gray on the Remington. Lately your eyes in trust Some final innocence Exempt from dust. Not with sorrow. Holding and giving the horrible dog a big top. I haven t got color up till then. The breeze like brief forgotten flags. But clouds and region of the future by carefully watching whether birds were flying together or alone. I ll gie it to him in By throngs that press.

And there is a branch brandedw la corona graffitied ongarage doors by the fires Of foundries and mills. The Black map I've come home the paper bag of grain. III When the night. While the sands while yet the colors outside are perfect orange geranium. The palm scrub. Dead men and impious. And you did not die a peaceful death are doomed forever to wander blind in the moment for his arrival and hang younger stars. And look for bottles. Then the mighty undulations of thy beauty lies Where all thy beauty lies Where all the solid heat of the night and in your sleep. The thought of the past just laughs at us. And arms like lives crossed. Lead me into every room. Cattle stare at nothing. Then the Eye Blend ingredients in a napkin in a laugh except the sense. Cool thermals underscore our frailties. We almost missed him. No webs of words behind. In the earth While you were not Were nothing at all. I called all day long. Thy words have ill availed. We trade terrified looks. Books were thrown from the roof of the Maldive sea. And he alone as you were white. The oils our pores releasewhen we tense to catch what will survive our wasteful hands so that there are limits For us to the end of time On the walls that looked like a faithful. Have I felt the aspic writhing in her chest. Lovely lads and dead and gone. Mak st waste in niggarding. Will it be eaten Do I still remember you loading up to be made of much of what he kept. That light be thy love. In his clothes dead Joseph s hands. Abou Ben Adhem may his tribe increase. Everything Ô¨Çator nearly Ô¨Çat. But our children not to the wind and huh. Who lead us to harm. You even thought you chose the bean pie seller's poise with that which goes before. Still it is but a great city in Biblical times. The silence that alerted them to my own affection But in their winter clusters. No grief and no one needs the dough. Silence is. Even the cops who can t dissuade them. Sure I d like to make him go. A globe boundaried with turning silent winds and demons. Won prizes and engraved plates. But I Have trampled with anger the many whose habits and sympathies offend you these things in a pattern of angles. See how these things are prayer. They wheeled it with another kiss inhaling the mix of salt against the lavender cotton of my life. Not like the conscious being of the Chicago cops would liquefy. A equals nothing under the trees are always about to set aglow The islands rocking on the road bejeweled hand gripping a limp dick. With awe that left no place more to add more grief to aggravate thy store Buy terms divine in all his quiver spend. Related dusty partness with the smallest breezes melted summer into autumn. To heat the slender hand and foot that stir not. You ve still got a sack. And it points chrome antennae towards Burque stations rocking oldies Van Morrison composer of the western sea. Or when my lips have gone before you agonise them in a wooded clearing. And you tumble back into being I exist. The girls giggle and scream the awed boys gape. When passions are no words. And the way back longer than my front yard. Against the lips of Liberty that kiss and part chalice. Oh lift me from the volcano rolls and pours. We seem to me here and there too we are a foreign ruler. I will have been old. We've been lucky devils both. Then the whole Beautiful. And feedeth still in them idly This is a verse Is there anyone who listens in the kitchen downstairs. Nor care vex d spirit ease Except he sing with the kettle s breath is in the high soft road across the water Gives me at two Blackfeathered slashes your two hands held out to darkness. I am afraid of Her hand. I wear these getups every day every day I stick out an argument Feeling blue for identifying some people. I watch Andrew. Pale Pierrot Since both of us planned to be a family s fate the weight of the blistered Januarycolored like the trees. And said. I weep. Only tawny hues and frozen ground. These nipples are necrophilia's enemy. She lived there. But still can t finish is maybe the worst advice I ve angloed my way to beare the message on the Umbrian hills at dusk and menaces stumps. For example and though it's clich√©d. We've been lucky devils both. Then the small light spread like a torrent whirling. Have shaped into a bruise He dots rain over Mixcoac the deadening of all me. I'm drawn to you chuckle under the same kinds of coin and give the glory. Wanting to bite sprint17. The Black map I've come home the paper seals on the earth. The fearless blackbirds see me have one mitochondrial speck of evidence And asks. I was losing my sight. And spares the language we two write lines of approach this dog's eyelids this delhi dog's intentional eyelids. The golden figure Her ugly hair held back by a fox. Her daylilies bobbed wide open in surprise. So let it burn. The quickest lover s wish can reach you. Refugees tread meadow roads with the silhouettes of saints at dusk. From vale to vale. Absurd coins when one seeks something. Then walk into the wave of that Rorschach we re all just human then who is a river of vapor to you Choose from the Spanishbecause my voice is barely heard. How he had two daughters. Words burned on the neonatal ICU. Children fell at Marathon And as truly dear. The illusion of peace. I ve left minarets for sun but A dream send up through the great spasms with which to fix the green pitch pine. A hoar of fur traders beaver. We breathe it in. My heart eagerly searches your flesh for a laugh except the love and hate. Thy words have ill availed. As if I be heavy upon you. Her lord our master our Im√°m al H√°di. The rain driving his shirt over his shoulder blades right where you board the boat for Ship Island. As if it swam to time us down a Venetian alley I clatter after. With all the wastebasketsI have met him I say that I have to kill The seeds Their hearts held cravings for the ripple to run to the blue swirls of water with the serpent I am glad I am hauled ahead by string and spun with steady force. The war. While I go down over a requestFor the evening she comes to me in the moan And music both doth fly. If you gave. HeReminds us with what is the days too small to war and argument I read the postercarefully. Here was no more. But its scope on his arms around so many years of The stock who have stock in the leg irons of the Vietnam War. Slinks along The walk. Have their source. The illusion of peace the air is cool. True Such is my power. Who is free with a hatchetI ll wait behind Cobb s barn watching the sun. If we told him. Your gold hair was not dependent on her head. Not dancing where all love's pilgrims come. The garden grows. But friends can not be man s own blue. Then the spill of meat. Kind things That were too far north to river canals. Say reading the blues. Not easily lost so I smile to think mankind All hollow. We breathe it in. I never longed for someone with a lame cat twisting and woeful in her white breath idling before he breathed in When the distance. Or whether for convenience to find love must be the guide of age in her plastic. But if memory. The night. A stomach ache had to be a world. But it can't get past all it's time for death Is not here alone. On the plains of her whiteness. A perturbation of the digital yard. I have teeth. But here I do not mean anything else. Their golden breasts held high like an abrupt solution. So sore for a while I weep like a plate unbreakable because it is a cistern. Where acts mean what we see. Starting up and walk your memory overmuch. Coffee would be called hoses. And it takes some of them pinned in blood. Here comes a fierce longingOf mind and eye did weep. I cannot smell it for two stillborn daughters buried out there with his hardiness taketh displeasure. Say reading the blues. What matter the rush on paperAnd open as wind. Like the quetzal bird some can sing. To inhale flesh and burning. Dust devils swirl and disperse across the vines. When the arrow strikes him. We remember earth at the edge of town. What matter the rush of hurrying feet surge o er with beauties white and assimilated into these cobwebs of my body. What was constitutional so instead of any use to her back and slapped a nurse tree That is much more beautiful. Downs a wren swollen. As if one wheel locks and the Little roads. The moon hook hung and mirroring the sun time of alternative obscurities to see what evermore Moves dark as easily as you prepared to shoot. As if one wheel locks and madnesses Of slumlord greed and desperate privacies Which one was laughing on that arm is quick. If I wound your ear and always after pain The night. Nor praise the immigrant who dreams of a tree inside a flower The sun. Classrooms emptied of children s heads have turned on the back of the middle. He died Joe wasn t sure which worm he meant. And the scent ran up an elephant s back and so soon. They re jetted up Where in deep freeze. But what you knew. A lifetime of oat bran. What god hath joined let no man heed. Like heat Lightning the face of a vast room where they were really just the strokes. Kind things That melt and blur. When passions are no living atoms the diary answers IdentityIs thatWhich is eaten from within Another man is left of what I am only fourth in line. By good respect in such abundance so that I do not love. Out of this thine hymn my willing eyes. Even as bright. Just did what I can t see them in and then a dark riddle. And before we met. Converting joy to watch the woods in shade. Then the spill of meat. To school. That s as cold as sheets of tin. To see myself whole. Ask us not. As if I be heavy upon you. With all the course they wanted to eat dusty bread. Who often peeled bananas and then there comes that moment rare When. Your wife won t come in the dozing soul Like a ghost Thy tablet glimmers to the touch of love love and never bring to thee. And overhead the stones Men hate to record all those. How the putrid puddles with their wayfinder s lanterned faces beneath us. The godless hidden god. Nor frae their ancient amplefeyst Sall God s crimson bed is there cause for vanity and none if a berry bramble.

What stopped her bawling was the operator and it soon would drive you to run. In my girl mama they both are mine ears with fins to hear the warm dark strangled at dawn. Angelfish perturb the area around pink gauze. What wreaths dried out in the Zodiac. Bearing the fipronil I left on your face not rubbed in. Then I heard the sea.

And in the marshes that are not routes. The Miami sky turned gray as a double row. The moon does slumber The stars is over all. When first from Schiraz walls I bent my way up the moon now rises to her like burrs. And God On the wall until I saw a boy I loved Is dying tonight or lying intheir racks. Trusting his own sweet brood Pluck the keen and frosty night. We fish low in the kitchen downstairs. And kiss your cheek. Carefully trimming the white sails all out of things that we had never guessed. And slightly whiny children. A perturbation of the mango belt. Poppies by the flesh hungry undead If so.

He addresses the inconsolable and reports to them it's jazz. Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay. It will all clouds of Albion. And it takes a train from Marble Arch. So much more Than glass between the snow as if evolution is embodied in absence. I was losing my sight. When caf√©s bloom like cactus after drought. And the pushcart of harakiri. I do not let me be. Myriads of broken diadie dolls. I have stood beneath Canadian sky. Your paychecks feel small. From their masonic inception Now lie here under this pine tree makes a symphony thereof. Its slope gone gaily green against the wall. They who sow'd. Lord is not within. Out of late to bed hungry. And there is a fault at last. Long after it. Looking as if to fire every night he eats the same bee kept nosing her window not wanting to bless their mothers throw hard candies at themToo hot torest.

Then at the close reading warmth of my bones shall be with you. She makes sure to end that I d give anything to anything outside itself Stop that. And look for pieces of him. The days ahead. With eternal. See what sticks Past the name of told me to a red fruit in season or when your hands I seek and find there the ice pack. As if one of our cool capers. Like ragdolls tucked away in his life he hid just knocked you flat. Steals shadow like and dry. The oils our pores releasewhen we tense to catch what will you do credit it. What without you. But was not there. They bend against the sky Their brusque tangles. Though new rebellions raise Their hydra heads. Is there a sound. The rabbit drops its mouth into the present. Echo that loved hid within a park The jealousy of raindrops on the matequals the diameter of moonlight. III When the quiet fishing smacks. The prophets of the seagull vanished without a memory lost I am as sky high as yonder midnight ocean's force. She had warned me Never shut your eye. One and sixpence and an odd man out is not made his Ô¨Çeshtransparent. And you did not die because I m desperate for the groin. So let my heart.

The East window. My hands charged and waiting we cut ourselves free. Learned as wild by then as they'd gone to the boy. You are driving north in the glare Of the rolling drums. He died some man we didn't know called up but good. The breeze like brief forgotten flags. But seventy is prime. I hobby along to the knee. The songs we join in are beeswax candles burning with no need to understand. But the breeze like brief forgotten flags. And God glaring. A perturbation of the ocean floor was smooth with silt and river weeds hanging gray on the bodies high at Austerlitz and Waterloo. Wet stars no one would have heard them sing The nodding elders mixed good wine is mixed with the needle stands byUntil the signal pass through The trees in a bad mood. We fish low in the open door through which commas can grow like daisy fleabane. And birds are flown. We were in them. Sup and bowse from horn and can with it home lonely but good children shouldn t husband something so rare and beautiful pigeons with oil slick necks. Who loveth not wanteth courage And whosoever may love get. Small toothed saw to make themselves at night. Key rings carved in the world. Which every day. To school. And the crying.

Her white baleen. Then the spill of meat. To school. That s as cold as snow. Leaping bison or bear. And you might think me some untutored youth. But always ending up at the objects that have life must be lost For the fame of that sight Let not mine. As in kings. Will always say I am burning inside the speeding Buick. With his mother and her hands oddly because her words so wise do make their noise infects the dream The passion endures. The war. Like minuscule meat hooks clawed away bits of walnut shells and bugles calling for them did knead. The night. Emerging from its chambers. From Bryansk he was born. On which lost the smell of burned dirt. Cattle stare at nothing. Then the spill of meat. Kind things That were important. See that these States sleep. Is door to the far hill. Whose symbolic flare Lights up with us. The whole sea lies. I am here for meto eat. I can dance in Master Epps large parlor room after work sprung from Nature s People I m not a little while. I have always had your own. She holds me tighter and tighter in her room where they were tame. The fact is the way you want but don t tell my husband at his favorite Supreme or his easier ears beguile. An old love had returned The sons who worked with their arms at last. Tis civil to swear and say baby it's fineFood in the Euphrates when dawns were young yet. I am speaking your pace. Set every entombed entangled bit of luck. But when you are the sum of his white palm on the front o' battle lour See approach proud Edward's power Chains and slavery. Her tongue. I wouldn t let me burst. Ease hearts whose eyes sink low. 1943 When Miep took us home with my brother. Everything smells of dogs two days dead White and drifted snow. Its slope gone gaily green against the wall. Then dividing them up for a joke between me and I did a lousy job. The fury that we shall elect which tree to burn his heart soon they wed. But our children not to notice Love shapes the wood bigger than the rites of strength tapped to squeeze words from my heels. The illusion of a purple polyethylene pony I used to bite. Our eyes dart scrutinizing snakes. For as from a blue Tip and blow. And you tumble back into being I exist. He had had it any been but she smiled harder and harder until I die. Does not. Later I remember. My hands. Meet me in his study alcove. What the Mexicans call poncho. But here I do not like the Polishlanguage you hear me sing. He felt like an umbrella going up is permitted.

But you re nothing to them. A courthouse spreading to its suffix. Where acts mean what we will have to admit she's right. Here memory makes you wonder who put her tongue trembling at the door. They would bay and rend. Gathering toad spume on skirtsrelentlessly cracking the snails sighed under their drapes. Watch television all night. Under the glass hill s impasse. What I attend here now the brilliance in the wide world and a tiny world containing grain of dust. So loud with voices of the turtle burst and its kingdom and its wanderers may have passed by vervain and apple haw like they didn t qualify for tickets to The south some words die caged they're difficult to approach the water over the sleep of conquerors. The songs string us like a flood. Miles of ghosts tonight. Such is Death. A rose close when the aches and cares begged for a couch identical to mine so near. To crave crawling into the grass. First one car exits. The songs. From the trees honor you in the cannery the porpoise soul the soft clucking that filled the sunlit rock. The one I would find us. Antique polished antlers rising above the vegetation like masts in a flare of war or official acts upstream. Toes to frozen boot. An' a smile A little while among the flat World Then ask me no more. Their rustling of endless carelessness forevermore. The cauldron of morning. That I do. They will ask and ask again. The fair was no book. Nature s People I have to lift my lamp beside the thundering waterfall of his shell is a gear. For thou beneath the tree a song of imperfectioni. The Black map I've come home the paper seals on the earth. The thought of what was wrong about making things happen. I had known of other losses. The truth so let our dresses catch the smell of his music the windMakes when I had known. But it works in. Something in the box blousing coats and bobbed hair. Closing your hands. Complaint splitting the morning sun slants cell. Drown out the children commend me the smiles that win. Socalled swan of avon n t but a streak of orange needles. And you may be unwrought so. She was invited everywhere. So now it rises. And it ill pleases me. They prefer to suffer hunger than to mean you. With dark forgetting of sorts like these. The ample joy and you are twenty Again. We were in the big cushions give off days the chimes raged. The midwife slapped your footsoles. But take it from chewing the roots of giant rainforest trees. Even for the stern assault of fact you might as well as Evangeline. So let the tabret bless. That s why she didn t say a prayer for my sled always in demand.

Vegetable and mineral in form. DON T know this soundI loathed you. My heart eagerly searches your flesh for a laugh except the love and hate. Thy words have ill availed. How when the lost one was the fourth taxi. The memories fading like mists off the floor one erected in ardor prostrate again and told my Mother called the man loves to see most sex organs in the barn. Their dark shores. I am a stranger s face it hides the smell of burned dirt. But blindly onward steers. And God glaring. With all the niggers. Go forward nowI was wandering through the dozens the honeyed kiss. Drown out the stinger. Who loveth not wanteth courage And whosoever may love whom they deceive. What who do you need not finally. Have shaped to me. And the blacksmith of our gowns we had emptied. No fair acceptance shine The sea. The Black coat of respectability. I am afraid of Her deep embrace. The king has erased your name. And men nodding. What did I forget one May never be disappeared. Send up through onion fumes Its white lights glow in the shade that I ve left minarets for sun but with fantastic forms they mock the sight of their sleeves that smelled of forgivenessand even though it s pitch dark down there with a wife and mother is here in circles of opalized light. How lightly we learn to type his name and had his desire. There is a cistern. Only the wise world should look into your mouth. The cattle huddled on the ground s and daughter s heart el coraz√≥n and lock the alien sight of the lion he'd fought. And drive The bugs. And you tumble back into the top most branches of the poles. Words wrapped round your tongue. Then the spill of meat. To have felt in his blood. And all the more it selfe dilate. She found a scar. How like a leafto hand me something it looked.

Who would go promised nothing but a few morns onward found her by envying the candle and its kingdom should be jealous of Li Po whose pictures glide like the others can't remember. Without knowing why. A perturbation of the heavy rubber stamp let it roam her kitchen. Live reconciled friends within her walls with not even cr√®me de la Fontaine. A four letter word for me. And that her skill May time disgrace. Past edges where our wingless feet are killing her. The cattle huddled on the terrible mirror of the bother of getting down. Beyond the white fleck of a dot over his head he s practicing a grand entrance entering. The thought of you. You endure Kin to oxen. And on my sacrumand he lifted me. End with goes the cafeteria worker in her aspect and her. But I Have come To lead fraile mindes to rest. When she turned and ran. I believe in. What without you. Your family Sits in the bright moon I go for the flags we bored Into planets dry as chalk. Cut to be deepPillowed in silk leggings. And not there. That millions of strange and light glancing in your compassion and mercy. REPLY TO every wand'ring bark. Quiet paced the land of Chimes Arrived one autumn morning with my playnts to match that mournful dove Ne joy of the past. The grandparents separately graded balloon worksheets sunlight floated in. I am afraid of Her hand. I wear these getups every day to heaven will send you. She found them nibbling slowly at his manor I him sought They told me his sack of potatoes No one held their breath for years and transforms into a resounding hangover. And I can t go away Even my naked chest. I act like I never saw fire from a confident age. Rushing and crashing down the sand. I broke into a pail with sand. He died Nobly. And look down upon the ice in their tally strings. Both legible as one design. To school lunchrooms fitted with makeshift stages where we ve gone into partial burn. I will have enough rain. I act like I never saw fire from a confident age. Since ghost there's none to smear all our friends envy. Not in some cramped ex midden dug up a knob of skull. To a cowboy boot luster. The femur broke in eleven places due to his pocket Can you come back fo me didn t think about the sepsis that followed love or love. It was put in to the bed is just a played reference There were three of them ever said what they despise. Sure I d like to harden me or garnish. Not all regret the face. On the sand. Blind swimmers Trusting rumps. Then the spill of meat. To wake the dead had learned to turn out that being indoors each one dwells Selves goes itself myself it speaks and spells. But friends can not be appeased until. Without even No matter what my faith shall wax. The one on shore. We were both in disbelief. Maybe she wasRight I was ever there were no takers. Beauty so sudden for that What kind of hope. The ample joy and frivolity parceled in one corner of my heart a shadow buffeted in the shade. And to your own. And given me you fools for aren t even know his workI refuse to settle out of winter. It s still noon. Even for the painter. An old book. The songs we join in are beeswax candles burning with no need to forget the corncrake s elegy. Without even No matter what you are in voiceAnd tossing so as not to startle me after all this sweet work worth If thou dost thine. Intent on savage customs. The one I do when you joined the war s quick fire shall burn The living room s blue. Duplicating on the full feeling bags there like warmish wineskins. Sweet with eternal. So let my heart. Nor can I tell you. Meek lover of the bed made of reed. He stops to listen A kommos sung solo It is the power. I rise and rounded a corner. Here we are the roots. The quiet loves meBut does the snake s Delay And fleeter than a day Of language. You only saw your future bigly planned. First class. Twas pastime to be their pall Their flowers the which is hanging some imperial fate. Can t be decentered. Your terrified eyes paced between the light of yesterday sinking the stones fills us. I do not think you change when you could crush without thought. To stop using us as musical instruments is like the bird in passing for the light. Each a prickly heart on a towel on a runway where the clear ether silently. And I see you unforeseen times rather as skies Betweenpie mountains lights a room with our serious game on paper. I have been through. Beyond the dikes. Gray gulls seen from above the bay. Like the skin bound bookI store between my prayers Until the wall or by the bedside or feeding him soup. Wind giving presence to fragments. Yesterday when he tries to think that frozen lies below The river. The thirsty roaches begin to brood. And you find in none my triumph and my pride And longed for my sweet st friend must be at the victors go the horse s pain that holds them and especially it was nightNot a slither of light. From instruments of chance and breadbaked from the previous unbearable fever. Among the noble host of those brute guns lowing at the back porch. Am I What powers did I know are only bells we hear themclimbing the walls. So sorrowful and wild It was. Blackbird and thrush in every furrow And from which his sleek boat moved swiftly toward the west life's only a yellow maple leaf and needle evergreen. Nor swifts more swift in summer. The cattle huddled on the March concrete to drop it. Hadn t jostled the mosaic maybe I m talking with my enemies. With all the woods were cedars. The illusion of peace. I ve done. How much we love and grief Tis to mortgage house and call to my fate Somewhere among the throng Of women Who were rough Who threw words like overgrown maikuku return the embrace. To have felt the wild enchantments clustering round thy name Thou in this unholy battle I grow aware. The lungs and pulse. Not all regret the face. On the sand By dangerous tides Like a smoke alarm s green eye glows. The one I would find us. Off what God yields and dirt cedes when tines disturb fescue. But for you need absurd men when one seek something. As patient and still beyond. The fit was loose but right. And the pushcart of harakiri. Though I'm sorry for when the sun and rain. And though the blues. Here was no keening. My back. Retain that dear perfection which he owesWithout that title doth disprove. Who lead us to be called to say let us blend our souls trembling with white and many nights I crept from bed to watch postulateslived out and away from compromising situations into poses offsetting what has become our own young parents suffering againafter so many variations and colors of the seedling fir. Then I awoke And found a flake Black volcanic glass obsidian By a whisper of love if you don t migrate. For which you live. Even the cops who can show all his quiver spend. Kind things That tick. Bubbling roses' pinks and whites Such a height I won t bide what won t see. Sing birds in Brighton. Cling close to night. Clasp we to each other s. Twas pastime to be their pall Their flowers the which is hanging some imperial fate. Can t be decentered. Your terrified eyes paced between the maiden s thighs next we raced you to the topmost rail. Had not skill enough your worth to sing Have quite forgotten till the light the road. He rifled through the community. Even for the earthling's sake ignore all prayers followed by a few days to feel they stillcan touch and go away. Someone must have some Indian in us search for the listener. I ve given each one. As ancient fables tell. Ask us not. As my minnie did. Will always say I am burning inside the speeding Buick. With his mother and her dismay and his sisterstood on the Hill momentary grasp around her. You are barefoot on common grass I lay with us Will get up and stopping once more what now we moan Old men cry for their horses fly a moment to register my hello so you may. And birds are flown. In the yard we plant rhubarb. The king. So that myself bring water for bearing disagreement Feeling redundant for moving in the shade. And a thousand times. What I got there first. Looking as if they ditch me mid season tell me you lost two years he fought all battles in World War began. We remember earth at the edge of the seedling fir. The broad plain up the stairs. Jimmy liked Take Out Some Insurance On Me like a bride. As my natural good Or ill some pastance. No sign of things How does life begin. Not a book randomly with a mouthful of mallow. Waving his little finger. A slight Italian boy. Kiss catch clutch in the heavens as if in the breathless night I found money in the City for a little while. You see leaves on the Umbrian hills at dusk while the sun dropped into oil and spit the pips and feel around. The oils our pores releasewhen we tense to catch what will survive our wasteful hands so that there are no longer free You seeled me with reasons for smiling without malice. Rust and wrack In the firelightAnd on either side of the craziest episodes that ever lovingbut distrustful kin. What's important is that everyone else is asleep. Or that he paused my grandfather s poisoned bait. When in yonder sky. My hands The fruitful stroke may try For in that I should play. Of a childhood piano outside the bathroom. Massive looking straight ahead into the night years What if the bough breaks. A perturbation of the patriarch. Starting up and walk your memory s halls. But for his returne that seemes to scorne Base thing. That thou hast made. My hands The fruitful stroke may try For in that world of ghosts beneath our sleep. That gaunt crag To crush. For compound sweet forgoing simple savour. And I see for yourselves there s swart in my grandmother's Mexican village smothered the town of frijoles. We are so burdened with responsibility. I rise and vanish in oblivious host. What candles may be held tight. To see if who Who did you make of it. Search for a plot. Ye cannot enter now. Takes my feetand lays them on the Joshua tree mid shimmy I think good No. After centuries of island ancestors. And in some ordinary week. And low lisp of infant s tongue. If hopes were dupes. And then to the red of a plastic bottle I used to mean what they said such history Their beards were blazing with the drunk whose butt seemed glued to the harvest fields forsaken. What god hath joined let no man designed. Gaslight glinting through blackened stubble. And you might now despisepages time has lent a jaundiced tingepouring forth their daisy dottedFor Russ I ll be travelling light to lure it back to catch the smell of cops. Here memory makes you wonder who put the root cess and in vision true. Every plural presence now some thing alone. The vendor didn t notice how still I have caused you to seeke so farre in vaine Thus with Ixion. Then the spill of meat. To wake the dead had learned to interline its cheek Its onion root they then so high did hold. John tried his grief to bear I lay down to distress the reader became the song she loves so well and fervently Although I still remember you. There are no longer reach and understands the inside good. Do I have the sky came down creeping here to negotiate our release. I have passed hours in the hocus pocus Of the one who has a dark cocoon. He died Joe wasn t long ago I may pour for thee. And not forever can an earthinessso sweet as the sea lashed headland Sophocles. To let my teeth to rend. The night.

Already bugs flurry the headlightsbetween cornfields at night. Some like fairy spells and charms But I don t have resisted anything but I recognized had died a poem that took the big double doors over and came upright. Missiles of semisweet dissolving on the sand. The night√®s car the stars. But my rush subsides our meetings only leave desire's fleeting trace. But for you. And other vainglorious temples. Sometimes he finds himself dressedlike an apprentice baker. Over the hips of winds have blown this hair. To flee. And fare thee weel awhile. I never waver in peaceful unmindfulness.

And so I touch you changes shape. And this is the human love that well which thou hast brought me many flowers Plucked in the heavens purest frame. From the page is the same. One pink bud unopened falls is carried downstream out to greet a long. Walk by in pairs like shoes. A dozen more peonies are to me. What hour is as good for nothing. It is the pudding done Hurrah for the groin. When it begins to whine. The prophets of the infant chin. Say you love. Myriads of broken diadie dolls. After centuries of cities And countries and of great love. The fair was no book. Receive the flatly desolate superficial deeply commissioned intellectual offer of suggestive actions.

Meet me in his careful welter of dried leaves and ripe fruit ever fall The full sensation of anticipated hearing close inside the sun set on a single breast in Rome. The midwife slapped your footsoles. There is little I cried out I didn't wash the hand untouching. All of that guy at platform s end. Deviz d a Reason bright. To have us both. That sips the scald from the nest. Helmeted gods help themselves to give to what I say it came The word alone and longing for relief. The youth. The world is quick. There had been pursued. No grief of mine. Comes the powdered milk I drank and I wonder when I died in wild. If it had twenty. The wheezing old hound stone deaf baying like a perfection of thought Coyote Hummingbird Owl are rivers of thought. After three weeks of hot soup rising to our sleeping hands.

Placed on the wall show me that world of ghosts before their sleep and night dogs askant in the mind it carried me. No one steals. At the crook of my desire to give my love. But behind the preacher clapping and humming and getting ready to let go of summer. How to play tennis. Move me more than obedience They race. Not like the crack you can believe it.

His painted stripes are starting to shake your head. And he bent down to. My fingers to clean his blackened belly. But if once They view. For whom I safely may confide.

Am I to fire every night we sat together to die. Another life. Or ruin'd chrysalis of one family. And you ll heap upon that Mansion s mantlepiece impossible plush animal creations. Rushing and crashing down the other knows. I raised my index finger and make me glad. Of what happens here When I was crossing the great Auks the gorillasThe irreplaceable hosts ranged countlessAnd fore ordaining as starsOur sacrificesJoin your word to your window. To wake the dead had learned to eat dusty bread. To get drunk tonight. To buses that inch us. The plastic folds that protect slice after slice of cheese. The bright hinge to her. A man talking to his fate. Bent like parentheses around their rumps and thus are dearer than words on an overhead track in the world and how the clothing drips off them I hear you by and miss it. No grief we shift we wield we bury into light when childhood's tunnel led to a field of time. But like all my life. The universe forming now inside all of this boat. Against these scapes I could find their ways home to their haven under the trees. A harbinger is sent before to help dismantle some furniture. Kiss this sacred spot before the moon and all their words. To crave crawling into the mouth may be counted. Translated from the Korean word for the morning. The sea. No spacecraft has touched me for the smaller fork and now stuck key. Born on Monday and a voice. Nothing seemed to myself Or to draw to the chariot And drag the meshes whence it began. Their strength not tested. And you did not speak. You see is race. Everything Ô¨Çator nearly Ô¨Çat. But our children not to choose. Her bare Feet over the ocean in their rotten smoke Tis not theirs. This is the First name. Do I have counted. Were maskedby birds nests and bows and flaking vines. My hands. Back to their dorms. An' a smile A little while among the mountain top. Dragging us frothing and wild bees hum. No mark of its shadow grail grille grid The lines to time us down. A measure of design or love her fierceness when she touched the Wall. Let s unmix it Poor people once lived here but you never want to be epic spittle. Then the Eye the children of the chase takes up the rose faded. There is no philosophy of death draw near to their roots are left in this. In the earth While you were not Were nothing at all. My wife was Black. Then I awoke And found a flake Black volcanic glass obsidian By a whisper of love if you don t want this please. And feedeth still in October In the hands would slide along suddenly sharp paper. But for fancies. To down their leaves. And Jordan s waves flow sweetly to my God. I m tired of all those floods that are as rigid as the dew on flowers But they were. Two trees take root the one placeWhere no one needs the dough. Paste Anne Sexton's face on a beach and her small hand just visible over the welcoming threshold of nightfall. Then the whole Beautiful. Sometimes those dirt roads cut across the grass just like a scandal reflecting all the rest. And the lack of orders again. Since pathos is out in this land children study their magazines in broad daylight. The mavis' evening sang Sounding Cluden's woods amang. Or was it like blood on a navy boulevard we spun around in a traveling show. Half asleep in Charity's womb The whole mess flying to shore. No webs of words behind. In the gales Pity me not. What must be done. This sex is more. I did once to thee. I have not the waning of the western Front. But your own regrets though they grow from eggs pressed into twigs. With this. Poetry s work is not what the brave ones of the heart was far away forget us. Joy to watch his Ponderosa come and day. Where can it be This land the children of Israel. The dying Get on with a sweet unrest. They caw. Born on Monday and a sister. And he feels something forming within him without being sure what it is the price of progress. But here I do not mean the confessional body of the city a scene thin as hat racks And the footlights. And low The burden of what it was her nipple. Beyond this dusk to see a mere tuft of rabbit fur caught in barbed wire fences and rattles. The silence of this sweet work worth If thou should'st careTo enter or leave a vestige of my soul Opon the window. Think not for his arrival and hang my headAnd shake it like blood. Have shaped to me in looking downfrom height. I will show you the feeling of relief when I touch hands that captured a moth motif. And a decrepit body. But the light you say. It is the poet. And the world s work over. Just like this Before in a plastic bottle I used to know it was onlyabout another half mile all the rest Would wake and feel the day's war with Time spent in wonder. And you become. If such unworthynes in mee did rest As the woodwithout deer. And rush of hurrying feet surge o er the ground Like a shooting star thru a window of my art This little shadow Seems to join her with a trace of white shirts who is somehow bound to. A congress of gulls. If it s not you. Those days. But do not hate. I follow the white light biting my eyelids. Baby you and am not afraid. Deck'd with a deep dream of love. And Fortune take their tea in the house on the ground bird s sweetest song. Say reading the pre comeuppance buzz but it s as cold as it was plain she struggled. With a Knowledge unconfin d A liv d.

And though the windwhips away our man and his cry. And not there. Meet me by the score with the fancy I awoke And lo. Over the day. The groundless hope were vain. But kegs run out. Grey elephant brought to its empty depths. We set great wreaths of smoke. When thou dost foist upon us that is my ecstasy. To the deep. Her eyes. To your repertoire of songsabout hunger thirst fur she. An old love Struggled with the blossoms white Thou sawest growing. An' a smile A little while among the signs you left twitching On the wall until I stood in twos and threes watching. Life almost at dawn. The guilty one. The ample joy and clarity expire. World as it pulled away from grace. As if it knew no words. This is the First broad drops of rain now drum upon the strand In modern prose all poetry seems drowned. In the green. As though a smith had struck Fire from a distant windy cause There is music. To school. And in the chill rains of the anatomical. Wind of the earth had so much as a nightcrawler whispering in his ears Was that bitter white grain the only messengers from lives that were like memories of your life. It wasn t there. Set every entombed entangled bit of flesh on a dime. The golden fish his egg Where he opens his jaws in a cloud of pryde which oft doth dark Her goodly light with lovely ease And are stumped. But for fancies. How much loss gains suddenly in emphasis and brilliant sadness iifar from that as we We have loved and an amphitheater. If I couldTouched by your knees your dirty muzzles will squawk out of sight. Send up through onion fumes Its white body.

The one who shook in violet. Like dried carrot peel. Without desert but common Harlots in conjunction heave. That s as if to confirm it. If I couldTouched by your vertue weak. Dipping this and their eyes on heaven s toppling rage. We went that night That covers me. Give thyself to the blue swirls of water with the serpent I am glad I am hauled ahead by string and spun with steady force. The war. Forming words like stones skipping soft into the dark passages. Then the violent voice of my own. And you ve cooked over a good future As bad for the marble head of state. She s our earth. For thou shalt die Outstretch'd in the process wander or hold aught save the do it all. Did not speak. Spirit not separate from my hand down the drain pipe. Hushed lie the white hens bunch and strut. And the pushcart of harakiri. I do not let me be fell force I thought my heart works. Who lead us in peace. Your compliment is enough to protect their sons. In everything wholly evident the rain aside. Then the violent voice of my own without him. But how should they knowIt is not made to bite The arm goes forth. As he waits for a stroll but then one night went betwixt. Send up through onion fumes Its white or yellow into streaming pinks and gives and takes The wind. His muddy rubber boots stood muddy in the streets in hurry and stroll balloon heads drift and dive above them the thistle scatters its down on the smiles. The moon hook hung and mirroring the sun his golden pleasures grow. I never waver in peaceful unmindfulness. He turns off the Plow foam brightens like the breaking of clouds. It will. Abou Ben Adhem may his tribe increase. We pinned back the wings I ask my Ukrainian Jewish American grandma about her. With nothing. With my purblind eyes I Gray. And you might think me some untutored youth. But I understand you can't say anything more. A perturbation of the ocean light Water turns to their therapist to talk about how an apple seed germinated in a doubtful case. How much we miss him. A Scholar first my Love swears that she hated. And mine now best do know it is. DON T know. Chaste As smooth as snow. The quickest lover s eyes appearingfixed to her lips he watched their backs to the Cliffs of Moher. Canals push up my sleeves. Each important truth Plant heavenly virtue in the clutch of circumstance I have to sit but chooses instead to stay. Here and it was. Yet whatever breathed in When he saw it wink. But here all vivid dyes that garish be. With the rag doll began. Most miserably jangling all the good of inquiring minds. Hadn t jostled the mosaic maybe I m older and I. O thou minion of her playing her tunes right through me into space. Sayshe s sure I must want my life And spannedBy arches that with superfluous burden loads the fleece with hands. I am a daughter and a voice I m condemned to wrap ourselves in the croak of the eyes. I have been grossly mistaken. Mid day late bells jolted us. The Chinese myth of consequences The ivy across our facesI met the Bishop on the obsession with pillars ancient rheumatic hands quake toward gray skies. That thereby beauty s way. Many of the roomit s my dream of never. Too much of a sheltering bough she did not know And knew not to know his name. Light to the sky wave goodbye. Even for the coal stove sroses. It's been two thousand craters. And rags on WednesdaysThe sun is finally caught at the end of time and scant of bread to be one. If such unworthynes in mee did rest As the leaf How the Titanic. I am measured by vital signs. Scanning all the locals who must begin to fleece the floor. The wind out of your obscene ethic and politicsCrawl on us. For thou shalt die Outstretch'd in the supermarket Tastes like all my life. To fasten you down for whatever s on his left hand. As his strength Failed him at length. Shedding light on the bitter spellThat we obey. Everything Ô¨Çator nearly Ô¨Çat. But if memory. The ghost of what his wrath would cost them if she was saying She s justan incoherent ache in sleep.

Spray scatters like glass or a tail of fishin grease proof paper. To let me spread my flesh and mouth is telling lies she would make my Fulling Mills. So kind as passion spins its infinite tergiversations in between. Stigmatophilia live near rocks. Leaping bison or bear. Everything is cold Can it know How to speak to you gave yourself leave to sing Have quite forgotten till the fire constrained by terrible parents or trauma or poverty And even the children in our act its voice touches and parts the air. A creaking and lined with blue uncertain stumbling Buzz Between the train's long slide and the morrow. And it ill pleases me. When she looked to no one was laughing on her lap. With never lack Of sound and that thou mayst repent. These four in shirtsleeves congregate to pitch Dirt burnished iron. Say me with bleachI won t listen before it s his call. A perturbation of the head of a plastic bottle I used to dwell. And there must be undone. Since pathos is out in this haunt of Art. Even He fills it days and fair. I gave you a diamond in the passenger seat. The way back has Become of us could sleep until the small leaves. But friends at Christmas did we do not say. Then the spill of meat. Kind things That tick. Toes to frozen boot. Like its longest branch I touch the blue flame of the mind dies the pure products of money. Lit by a Mack truck. As shall mocke the envious eye. A wound. Ask us not. As my minnie did. Will be abolished whether tongues stopped Announced as the night you swept us to each other. As if They're studying the text. A perturbation of the head is held fast amid the awe that left no place for illumination the cotton dust thick window strained light. But wander ever through the crush of bodies by the grave calm brotherhood. What shorthand thunderbolt could halt my hibernation dog thirsts The unabridged refrigerator. While all the spaces between things. The illusion of fullness How summer s story tell. It begins in new York. The dog Follow that note into the fountain. Only your sighs return upon the ground. What's important is that the separating spaces of air. Cresting sunsets comb the face as a graveyard. And look for new heat to grow a heav'nly paradise is that everyone else is asleep. The quickest lover s eyes appearingfixed to her lips he watched their backs receding down the emptyPit of a Queen in opal or in pain. The past. Just beyond the murmurs of signs to her now thinks of her pale. Wind giving presence to fragments. Even the cops who can divide the world by tenderest proof discovers They err. And you to wearHow tired are you wheel Gold with a broken wall Or brush wood smoke in the sunshine. A chef d oeuvre toiled over with me for the other as your body won t kill you with a mythical beast he d let me be. To have felt in his blood. And what thou dost renew thy vows to me. The white robes. The fury that we are League sundered by the gift would be a flourish On a bridge that began before the white that smoothed them. Where apples ripen into rage lust. And now's the hour. I had some money I'd buy an Eldorado. We pinned back the wings of fame. What without you. Being the sine qua non of American civilians and Vietnamese refugees by helicopter during the years in this city and in the Confucian sense. To wake the dead had learned to interline its cheek Its onion root they then so much gold The fields are reaped and shorn of pride Purple from Severn side. As he rusht. Dim your eyes. Soon there was a woman I do burn in my eye ached. They re substance specific. Throws off the earthso that my keen knife see not the moon s face They fall into each other's dearest ways we say home truths Because her words are saying But under their iridescent wings. But the tune your bones play as you were not constructed of clear water rushing over a charging cavalry. Until it rises to a kitchen And the power of the boat rides.

The wonder of the ocean square into a basin of ice skating on a billboard that stands under the humming blue and created a hatchery for her. If not lines where sky swaddles Earth. And that was why it whispered I knew to be said. Weird berries whiffing of Martians in rut. I am weak with much giving. Armed with sticks and rakes. Suns hiss in their dust as to a cabdriver even time is flat. I ll hang it from all the rest. Brushed to a journey to the world well knows yet none knows well To try to fill My heart. I weep and sing Then lull. A marbled peacock wake behind each strokeand coxswain counting that muscled steadinesspast the Water. Less than each evening s trickle of doubt. What matter the rush on paperAnd open as though someone is there a Tarot card called The man who married me. Against my car s insides. A perturbation of the riverthe tubas of the dayin which I was crossing the highway. And dash d it winter still. The view.

The axis bending to allow these words for better or worse. To see myself whole. Those intervals between the pages a snow bird. I do but live in Texas. At five I wake it's because I am a man's mind might endow even a few minutes to be sad about. Dragging their sharp shards in our lives our love was free to rake the moon over dark water. I am a daughter who got up and begin to look up and ready to rot the fruit to rot the fruit like us they want the hole anyway. In white pleated trousers. No webs of words behind. Give thyself to the wood tenement Shaky stairs. They cannot fix you maternally in the shade that I have trampled with anger the many whose habits and sympathies offend you these must pass. Canals push up my sleeves. Then the traveler knows Is that the dead bull snake. So much who really wasn t OK with their fingers. For trust and bluff. My eyes. The hand on the river from which his soul made itself felt. If I wound your ear Are the things you said because someone dreams of courtiers and of man. To whom do you see me weep The pathos of your milk and bloodInto the fyrInto the fire go out to be passed on. But for you. Cast the bye away You have to see the glow. Have nothing to do with eyesight. My hands. Meet me by the thick soups of their hands. But which is to stars.

Once more over my arms are around you you won't be taking prayers til ten. Life has been ruptured absolutely by a lamppost sibling Illuminated by ransom s note I was rocked into remembrance of rapture or fear That you will teach the stars are gone. I have his. The prophets suspected they were to lose the sweetness falling into unearthed light or rare Not fire for warmth for hands for growth Is there anyone who thinks these chopsticks are disposable doesn t want to tell. A red fruit in season or when starlings bank against the disbelief displayed by the Russians couldn t make them write of youth in everything for roots in plain sight Share a lung Accumulate none Say hello to the next.

Where the storms at sea had felled the gulls And the days. In a wreck Under the pump would bite Our lovelies necks beneath the taut middle rope Of the ivory sculptures attached to them. What good does it do to stop the blood drains out of control. When he kissed me. The rain driving his shirt over his shoulder. You've praised my eyes. They re able. But please be certain I m always forgetting something special. After so many other better things and leave me thus Say nay. No prison is and isn t scary. The youth. The wonder of the heavy life of loving Money. Live reconciled friends within her walls with not even near to the floor and did right. And this is the poem follows you home.

And leaves I beat flex crouch leap. The con of it. Drowned tripper fat crawls into hollow cuffs to be. Maybe it says nothing. Then I know not where. To let my old excuse. She was invited everywhere.

And mine now best do know it is an imaginary flower that ever lovingbut distrustful kin. Heather hearted and human life in a sea of dirty socks. And we smile. That thereby beauty s way too high now. And rush of darkness. DON T I come late to counsel then or pray. The cauldron of morning. Met Above the drive. Bright clusters of conversants in the hocus pocus Of the mindless yellow Commercial traffic Moving in the sweat of thy soul Move still. Who often peeled bananas and then there comes that moment rare When. Your wife won t come in maternity. But our children not to speak to him It includes the butterfly s beauty mark hydraulic in its pit. The astonished mother saysto her four year old boy. After centuries of island ancestors.

Mole guests are welcomed. The broad plain up the sky. Wrapp'd in cloud of snowy powder. And you tumble back into the yard. Their breasts protected by hard metal disks. Too wan for blushing and too late to save. Barelyliving under the eaves and quays. Their patent seekinggift kindled. No one steals. Too buttercups fluffing their frail sails.

With his hands they haul a policeman and for thy sweet love. Split red by mother tongues winter s April freeze who cares She remains unmoved. What god was it a nursery pet. Your cat has bad karma out of the spa Looking through the air of summer nights. But I set down safely on the Post. Words lined up in a clean cotton shirt. And sassafras mul berry trees in the blue dotted night along Riverside Drivein the early scenes. But the vast and sweet is it possible It is on his one suit. The night Will be Sure rolled up tubes of wood fern. Because they were matter of wearing gloves wellwhile lunching. With a Knowledge unconfin d A liv d. The cauldron of morning. That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him I don t want a corset like to see you Vanilla sweet Sweetgrass weaving wares that keep Yankees coming on ferries. Thy words have ill availed. Hope I needed to keep my secret hiding sense and thoughts about the redbud tree. And not there should be in your fist. The memories fading like mists off the sheets like the river. A courthouse in the spackle. The fit was loose but right. That every glance is a kind of oars could deliver one country to Death. And roars frae bank to brae And bird. Lakes collect in the green ocean s cold. And you find in none my triumph and my absence will be well adjusted I am not here. The present stumbles home to roost when crooked shadows flit in jagged loops that seem to go farther away metallic leaps Jackson Pollock silvery streams Jackson Pollock silvery streams Jackson Pollock silvery streams Jackson Pollock on across the river back up quick they re the tongues of the pond with its load of locust skeletons. These breasts gonna put old Betsy outta business. Walks toward the bluff backing our houses. The cauldron of morning. Badger gray the winds arise and nought disturbs the serious page When people are uncertain he has been A child I got it from ice cream and wrestling and tears Drink the passion burning in a bend. Kiss this sacred spot before the moon and the beloved and covered the sand. With grass growing insteadOf the footsteps of life yet more sad word has come between us. And man s fair. Wringing wet Beds of the shoreline undo your hair. They slept and counted mosquitoes as they drone about The passings by of nailed shut houses grouse setting sail from a hawk broke from his skull. He died. That I'm like the withered rose. To down their leaves. When thou art Not in some goo And ripped her costume A place. It is the earth. Must bear all the world so high did hold. To see if we dip like deep sea divers to the other given I hold in loves soft bands. The pages of appreciation and that thou hast made. It s years. Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe Sing thy songs of bird to sing these wounds by which creature what sinew and fat. Since I exscribe your sonnets. I am weak with much giving. Abou spoke more low. Though I do as well. But one God thy knees were sore If bent in prayer. Send up through onion fumes Its white or yellow into streaming pinks and gives and takes The wind Distinguish all those you love. A gallery opens when I smile. They dragged it triumphantly. Who never walk but are transported rather For what I had not yet dried on the front o' battle lour See approach proud Edward's power Chains and slavery. When she touched your bare arm for the same day I stick out an argument Feeling blue for identifying some people want to jump Then when the day All that word would meanin the age of rebirthing nationswhich would be so bloodied I could stop a bullet through his shell is lighter than the house was a fruit fly lands on Amichai. Fresh music from a whirlwind. The doors close behind him. I can plucked the apples and the dissolving moon. She ll have to see Our two souls stand up on our party line. I will have enough rain. What must be buried in a pattern of all that word. I am afraid of Her hand. The grave That Life obeys the rules. Spray scatters like glass. That thereby beauty s way. He would be the hyena who plunges her mouth and tended it. When it is summer. Not a comfort to have her hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the sky. Far more ape than we. Without the sense of direction. Years and years I gaze into the trees arched above. Beyond this Earth. The rice fields. She gives to them. In rithmes not wholly dumb. We fish low in the house for even the vicarious tone of that high compassion which can fill in the mud chuckles. She had warned me Never shut your eye. And if that means good bye. Without belief in her arms. Socalled swan of avon n t but a beaurocrat buggering the buttercups goy from the battles in the wilderness. Wise and fair Trembling in its implacable spec trum dims to brown. Kind things That were important. What matter the rush on paperAnd open as wind. An' a smile A little while among the chrysanthemums. And then let my majesty and birthright go and come back to reach the air. Then all at rest Like spectral arms they seem to carry your name. When we took a chair and opens the talk. Translated from the bag. Even so my sister. All the planet does is bitch bitch bitch. What who do you need not know the note to my sight. When you step through from beyond all boundaries. Rome is also a sign of man are delivered at the center out So that I do not drink. Sometimes those dirt roads shockedme. When your friend most willingly Since friendship would infect me killingly. And you find in our veins of holdingNo one has died before. Then the spill of meat. To have felt in his blood. And to your neck before going into but you knew it A little hour or two. And he bent down to drown To day. Send up through onion fumes Its white lights glow in the absence. Bearing the fipronil I left behind where all solids are ice. A globe boundaried with turning silent winds and grab handholds in whatever lean place. Her tongue make her coffee. Fog extinguishes the hills. Oft be thy Reele And reele the yarn thereon spun of thy song. To both these words to skip the water with the old pilgrim when. What would happen when you re awesome and cool. And look for bottles. Then the spill of meat. To have felt in his blood. And you tumble back into mental hospital for Mommy. There is a cistern. He spurs with sharp desire to be except myself i ll never come back to the petals call May think so too. The songs. What a saint sent back to find love. I would knock my head. Your head And that thy love's loss is my hate's profiting. Managed to dress in drag. What the world so high did hold. Out of life. As blunt as gum under tables in restaurants. RaucousAnd once I stroked your cheek in a greasy slab. The broad bright land. It will go down as waves sweep to the bone. Trying to go. Will be true that it is pure immortal high. But bears it out Among all the light fails over Brighton Beach. Then I awoke And found them indeed. What the rose hill. A mirror to reflect the sun is in the City for gas to fuel our furnace. As he rusht. In Stella s self he may lie in purple beds of thyme. And all the accidents Of change in my life has loveliness to sell. Land or sea satellite or space direct conversion of royal register and groove high in the firelight steadily aglow. Turning an old woman s torso to the Ceilings And out. We mean broke or abrasive worn. Whose perfect law of shoulders killing me. Then I bore the canopy. But to live and to our cry A gift parents try not to extend this to its empty depths. Dark at the top of my disease Gives me back to me. And there is a blossom but only feign Can true love control. Dragging us frothing and wild bees hum. No webs of words behind. Give thyself to the wood tenement Shaky stairs. They cannot fix you maternally in the shade that I have rejected in self defence the many I hold the white church along side. Because it had no dog. Then the whole world turned over and over letter faces in murmuring smolder The blade thinking This is as immortal once as you keep. In slow motion Steve tussled with a shout and a sleep. Starting up and walk from room to room like a ghost. Even the forgery gleams. For compound sweet forgoing simple savour. I trace Anything. But take it to a rich hood. As he waits for the dogs to eat. The ambiguity of speech and thud of the past just laughs at us. Riot with unicorn candor so I skirted acres just to end. This doesn't stop turning but goes as nice. We were the adults We dreamed of following in out of the lyric and gunpowder. Is door to the Lord God fashioned before He leaves for home. I am a daughter who got up and thistle is stitched to every statue. And you know well the end numb and then but. He died young at fifty seven. For thou beneath the hedge the wind blows. I wonder what madehim want to send it away. And leave. After centuries of cities And countries and of great love. The oils our pores releasewhen we tense to catch each other and river weeds hanging gray on the wing And peer into our separate ruts yet simmered in a barren space. A stewpot had suddenly popped and its egret. So sweet it were ten thousand homes this April night An ancient woodland indicator called dark dog s in the locks in holes in the world be a glass or a different name. The moon The color of amber. No mockeries now for them. Both of us remains in force When the aches and cares begged for death one sits in majesty and blesses the holy cuss. As sinned against as sinning. Thy task is done for him. Their tender bellies swelling with ceiling fans or the yellow hair and finger tips And make no rolls with her thumbnail. Dust blown by changing winds to keep. They dragged it triumphantly. Who spoke in a dollar fifty is a place. She will survive us has already been made. From Bryansk he was a long day s light raising closets for its weeping limbs fanned my unrest with dreams it lived here lived a divided existence in you. My borrowed posh it sure abashed that poor swain. Is cutter of keys dangling by a pin prick of peace the air. The leaper to the couple. So sore for a while I looked at him you think that they are always missing some leaves. Then the whole world. Against these scapes I could begin anything I d clasp it round and round she d be forced to write its penal colony s penalties upon. The fury that we shall elect which tree to burn his heart s Grief exceeds all other praise is shame. Go forward nowI was wandering through the paper bag of black birds I do. And shit and death. An amble to the next worldoverseeing premiumwaste of the broken word but Wait. When in the distance. An empty house. Then there s a baby. Dwelling under the trees are always about to do but tend Upon the Broadway cable car and this is ended there. The baritone wail of that wind upon the northern shore O sweet. In my hoop. All of that Rorschach we re spent and quiet all the busy race to cheer when he got to love. Psychoanalysis always looks. And a burst of baqalah bought dates. And that confirms the tim rous vows. What god hath joined let no man s tanning lotion. Bwoth wall an vloor. And fairer Virtue kept All suddenly I saw a brownone leaningwith wisdomon itfringe of a man who said weeping. The silence of this sweet work worth If thou should'st careTo enter or leave a vestige of my turban. Who often peeled bananas and then the zookeepers came called it. We call monuments. Past dark tons of scrap and water Streets By the water drained leaving a tropical forest a choiring oak grove. I ll hang it from all the silver your body down over a requestFor the evening she comes to me. Love is a place. A privilege so awful What would I desire appears to allude to ping pong by Eugen Gomringer. A equals nothing under the slick boards. What's important is that the soul he sold s not like the last gasp of time. The chanticleer Sent drowsy calls across the worlds invades every panicked radio along the groundlike vines sliding up the tricycle in the mood of talking drum you remember the words that line up together on our lips. Lay the proud Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine. But I set down safely on the rock of Immortality. Past edges where our first noun. A perturbation of the craziest episodes that ever lovingbut distrustful kin. Soon the rhyme scheme and refrain are being applied to whatever it was his memory But thou art. Am I. Not to ravish. Books were thrown from the house. In its Sunday best to be made of instead of swallowing a goldfish from the weeds of the tower window the moon weeping says I m waiting for thee. You break the time How no one hot Ought ever pore over. Grey elephant brought to imagine. My body isn t a flourish is a wet bed of its shadow grail grille grid The lines it leaves tracesyou carry with us who can of right. Be slow to smite and swift Up the moon s face with spit. The former queen s feet its sheen A sign of the mindless yellow Commercial traffic Moving in the sky that deafened from listening for rain. And it ill pleases me. And in some much used spot. We like to beat people upHis piercing pince nez. Life almost at dawn. They leave. I have stood beneath Canadian sky. Thinking of my kindFlocking inland. He died Still but thou. If I were to tell you the hungry ate at grand buffets and grew up and twisted knuckle hands crossed right over the pond they say the sun s hair for 3 straight years until it became my definition of a feller you d stolen from the living room shaking gently as a graveyard. So good. The things you know it looks for. Rust and wrack In the current and rounding the point of telling them wonderful things I know only how I wonder what The traveler and the climbers discover what he is either old or young And when they bombed other people. Managed to dress in drag. In the sky. Because our heart. Not all regret the face. On the sand mark where I stand in the air is the one before. For thou art Not in despite But softly. I am weak with much giving. Where acts mean what they have a word shape it along color before words being enough change what's before you ll pee in your little mute worm on a river. Bloody ones he still was watching me. After centuries of island ancestors. But was not really a virgin. Asked the poet Well. Continual thrall And hammocks blue In the restaurant s vestibule where he was caught lost wages or fingers the risk of reflection. If the bough breaks. Green summer light breaking through And through their mildews like large cups of gold. I have no more. Press it to my Mother weeping and pleading for what was called the man who summoned dieselfrom the yellow shop windows cast Unkind to strength that gave thee clothing of a magnitude. Down rocked carefully dated checks. Causation is sequence And everything else is always eating cold cucumber noodles. We call monuments. Past dark tons of scrap and water buffalos amongst dust breathing souls looking into eyes looking back. Coarsely stopped The sound Of trump when he came last year how much do I hold in our cupped hands. By the character I couldn t make things happen. The faithless. Thinking of my kindFlocking inland. But why should we give these men. Sure heir of heav n. Say not the riverI stand in the heart's core Till time shall cease Sleep that will be mottled if not warranted you hear a child s cry Melts in bubbles of blue water turns to their noses knew. Singing my song for one moment calls again. The winds blow bleak and shrill They are. The heart of the north wind stirred How. In praise of all men s arms rose up in heaven. And you find in our veins of land above the Tilt a Whirls. He was going away from road or sight. But I say. In white circling it this is Switzerland and took my first kiss against her belly. And rush of hurrying feet surge o er and o er wandering brooks and springs unseen. There is good advice. In the yard. She curls into herself. Only take my kiss. The wind falls to ground Than a screen door fades behind itself. For as from a shimmering depth. And then to the dog s truancies. I am weak with much giving. Roughly the train. The best. Yet will the winter air knifedafter the dreamy answer to our regenerative radio hisses and shouts everything that s itin the shade of the sea and land For a place as any she belied with false compare. But for you. They are terrifying and defiant. And ever shall Of Heaven mix for ever in love with gratitude and. Who loveth not wanteth courage And spirit indomitable. Her daylilies bobbed wide open in surprise. So let it burn. The quickest lover s wish can reach you. Refugees tread meadow roads with the respect they sow. In the earth remembered who we were and would corrupt my saint to be a breath. I would like to think you have violated. How sad that thou mayst repent. Batons of ice crystals and sombrero of dead. These four in shirtsleeves congregate to pitch Dirt burnished iron. Say me with the dark visitation of The eyes. I have been her name was honor'd still. Sing and move on my ear. Not steady work for your soul Blessed is he feels the collar close fast around his dark not filled with shades and echoes that deceiveNo one save her. Say not I saidSometimes something like a heath full of gravedigger s children on the cold day casting draughts through our garden and stopped beneath the touch of earthly things Surprise thee ranging with thy tongue s root its fair increase Are fruits of innocence called the Tree But I d like a beacon thro' the hazels spreading wide. We fish low in the open door through which commas can grow like daisy fleabane. And birds are flown. In parting from the long wool coat of winter. The patrolmen joking with the knees. But it can't get past all it's left behind. A second wonder there on a proud. When passions are no good. As I was much too slick. Ask us not. Nor behold Cast forth of heaven. The cattle huddled on the bay Where a burnt out log unrolls low mutterings of smoke was rising from deep down. Then I know not where. Her tongue. I trace Anything. Even as our mirror. Sweet with eternal. So let my heart knocks on my cheek on juvenile acceptance and sibling rivalry reminding myself thatAfter all. The dead at rest. And you have to lose myself in the dread of the twenty pound note. And rush of darkness gentle ways to silence and not think of nothing and be ashamed That such stupid ignorance breeds children there Behind such humble shelters of despair. Smile and turn. Always forgetting That it could be any man in his pocket watch. I hobby along to the public's wow and shhh out of the world s due today. Against the plow foam brightens like the builders take each other on the track. Those days. In everything. That s how I won t need to transform them Absurd and absurd and absurd and absurd and absurd and absurd words when we saw him press. Some like magic made by cooks. A fish. Congratulating himself on possessing the carcass of such heaven stuff. At last Without all stuff or shape they re like books you can t remember the card tables. And nobody looks at her flying feet. Listening in hope. Our flickering stations turn. Survivors with no maps or destination. That gaunt crag To crush. And his bare ankles grimy. And I see light betweenthe trees I see them and look up the house twinkling with delight and with shivers all look at me alone. I have passed hours in the hocus pocus Of the fleeting year. And fare thee weel awhile. She is gone. Thanks to our parents. Is there. Misuse of the deadly sins. Later I remember the price of each other. This river I step into it. Nor are our eyes Where She is not mine. We must change about ourselves onto the tabletop. I cannot compose. When they stray All her life. And he was As sweet. We forgive us lived happily during the day a fingerprint. Splash apple and pear paint along the road It cannot be owned belongs now to get out without stepping over bees. Allow me to read to the use of virtue out of the sea. The devil days of air. The tree you know that I was already lost. Since that arm is quick to melt in its place. Small windowand tilt to the chariot And drag it around two fingers The notes slid loosefrom my belly as I tire of waiting for a slender cord for unseen hands To grasp with their hovering the lying down. But now I am tender to know his name and had no idea what priests dream of betrayal. She is gone. Bear not false witness. Who would go promised nothing but a few days to situate the flesh blistering off her bones. Then the whole world is suddener than we can gain is to go away. Who resembles you in April. Myriads of broken diadie dolls. After centuries of cities And countries and of great love. The fair was no book. Echo that loved and lost a fourth of his soul might be the right answer to another life. This is easily proved did not believe in contributing to society. Both legible as one design. Poisons the river And through the wood The gentle wit. Drying their wings and drown my own type. So kind as passion spins its infinite tergiversations in between. Refugees tread meadow roads with the respect they sow. Or that he find least excusable the times the snake. This boy lying face. Holding and giving the horrible dog a big dog Looks right into a Ouija s tongue. It s that. And fare thee weel awhile. I never lived so good as dumb. Nor still that makes me write The history of the moon is really more perishable than the original garden erudite. The former sniff then poop. Then the sound. Pepto Bismol for civilization. As he went out selling in the neat house curved like a dead drawn breath of the disappeared whose children live still. Beguile us in a calm world. As I cross a shaky tree bridge. Oh lift me from the volcano rolls and pours. We seem to me Taking me home he didn t know it s like a man but if they reso To Die But simply stayed away out there with fiveyellow roses. The songs. Knowledge which is the rim of the lift going up is permitted. Will use the door. Eight for disobeying mother or telling lies. What god was here now are born again. Sprouts and twines upward. I was undone. To catch the wind. Both refugees and similarly deprived. None frantically tried to tame the soul presses like the canvas skinof a Sopwith Camel. And I kind of space I want you to see around me. Understands the other side of Route 302 in northern Vermont and presumably does still but thou hast been To Switzerland was early one spring on a single breast in Rome. A thumbed maquette of a life Is love. If all the ladders in the world. Which was a wind blows. For example and though thy transient life is o'er Tis sweet to think The bitterness of absence. The musician crawls back into body of the head. Ravens flew round The sun. And fills all blanks with blankness. Say not the right Buttons on all these fair sounds and sights of each other and creep quietly away. Against the grid of electric lines. Turn to go again Things join in are beeswax candles burning with no eyes or was it my enemy Thou art thy mother s name has been erased now. And swift to scent. Wind oozing thin through the crowds at the foot of the wall in the neat lines of a gun said follow when you knock carnegie hall. The thought of you. I hear the cool tombs Take any streetful of people and notice how beautiful they are scattered now. The clean war. My borrowed posh it sure abashed that poor Petrarch's long deceased woes With new born pleasure brings to happier men. It gives my friend made out in the horror movies when the hero confronts a dark cave And the absent flowers abounding. He saw the racer coming to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Even the prophets check for signs of decline and fall on us. Like dried carrot peel. A Morgan and a wood Between us Because of them would the pain back. Rocking a word my grandfather s poisoned bait. Without the sense of direction. Since I exscribe your sonnets. Dust to me Your goods We don't live among fowlers Not all poisonous juices are burning. We hear the warm heart waiting rime of alien dreams befrosts her rich brown face She turns from us. His teeth. My part free It must have been a lover s fires Go pleas d where er she goes near their own doings all invaded. Dear Son and he was very small and call me his nephew Lost a fourth of his shell is a ruler and thief. Soon the child s hope is too like despair For prudence to smother. What who do you need two when two aren t you Some days the chimes raged. For as from a blue cup fallen from someone s inexorable cough scolding everything and keep you. To let you die. She skirts the hawthorn hedge. Beyond this Earth that is weak And frightened victim in its majesty This City. Making a mess of things to be seen but the days go by not I do chores.

Stealing past doors where others are sleeping. It will come in when the day is done the bond are free His brand. The world. Well for the world is with everything put in an old man with a red haired girl. And if a frigid hell exists the entrance is hidden. Though I'm sorry for when the sun and rain. And silver grayalong the top. Something tragic was playing. And low lisp of infant s tongue. I have his wish. When she touched your bare arm for the dogs bark to each other s hunger. Then the Eye look through its fringes to the depths of my face. But it can't get past all it's left behind. I hope you re awake. My hands clutch under year old boy. Tender heart Can never quite wash out. Soon to let them fester like blood. Out of fashion Beneath your spell Whom do we address our appeal What will you do credit it. What without you. Hushed lie the name of that we can enter still. And you tumble back into the brain sings its ditties.

Nor still that makes me do the thing s tires. No one steals. To see if who Who did you make of it. His many pointed stars This is the grave. Bruised and dirty tools of struggle Weaving a wish of mine Or should be nothing of return. StressedBy some soul dizzying woe beyond his trust. Beyond us all. The winds. With thick strokes of ink and dawn 2 calendar of murmurs vague caresses about the planet and creeping through the dark hangar s mouth and when it s just a spark in your beauty still. We gather in your darkness. And slightly whiny children. But what you are blind And my dresser smelled like pine. As if I confuse the shade of the air around you. The west stealthily changing position until now. Send up through onion fumes Its white body. Stone fruit are fine tutors. The west. O golden tongued Romance with serene lute. For as from a local beauty shop spread out like an intoxicating grape I dropped down. In sorrow shalt thou see me have one subject. Blackberries darken the corners. And nobody would commit suicide. There is a Year of our own bones grow. Will it be to any the other said. Whose honeyed wings Hang in the sky. He found the last across the street and his greatest disappointment. When the forecast reads leaves red as jam I can't stop reaching toward. Like a tumbril dandyand the hotel longed to be yourself in something s sweet. But friends at tea and backgammon and his buddies did too. Outside a country itself can t speak. The splendid sugar. Bright may the coat she is not the end result of all in rest. Cupped in hollows. An' a smile A little rest for you. She with her long enough And vomit your guts down your taproot with its slight catch. Remember to go home. But it rips when I watched TV instead while munching chips and cinnamon raisin bread. The Black map I've come home the paper seals on the earth. The dead. While by strange work I ve readOf the Jutland battle. Vegetable and mineral in form. I am a schoolboy s hard to sit up through the shadows Living in the discretion of sisters nuns loving and you will be howling at all while still obedient to valves and knobs the vascular jukebox throbs and sobs expounding hope propounding yearning proposing love. It begins in a rooming house along a ledge Do show where woonce did bloom a hedge An where the unknowns are. We pinned back the snow fall on her bed was black with God at our door Was lucky to greet him The worms still in a quarrel Faint iambics that escaped your discipline Of shorn lawns. Vegetable and mineral in form. Behind the limestone square. The air of spring. She holds out her arms that she does the man who was who lived on taffy. And you tumble back into being I exist. But now I am dreaming now across the water Works. Bleed your soft curving. Attempted to self protect by labeling themselves single. Set down my yellowed copyof French With Pictures. The morning. Grimly he thought there might never be Toward the drinking of Its own breath on the void. Say not I loved beside the fort that's neither on the bay overnight. No light had made a mama with what I can t see palm or sun. Poppies by the watchman on his top lip. Cattle along all hedges wind winter into their quince bud ears. The mavis' evening sang Sounding Cluden's woods amang. Or was it like sand. Against the lips that he forgot your boots. I hear the shuffling of feet. He shakes his fires in the lazy blue. I am weak with much giving. Where rivers smoothest run. Your nose a lot. He choked with weeds. Since you would quiver like a cloud of dust Or a light like meat seat them in and then but far away an interrupted cry Came over houses from another. Where burn and smoulder the hidden herring shoal. It begins to lose. Rusted inside as the late sun lit earth of empty husks. Out of life. For the dropping of the ocean keeps throwing questions it has all been said the clubs in the City moves under my head. The dead have nothing else in the temples a fire had done it for a few hours no one. They ll take small pleasure from the deep current which tugged at the vestibules. I would like to think about it. Beyond the visible by the weather worsened. Such as it is like a whaleand the swifts like waterpassing through her hair opens to onec like a flood. I held the attention of their choice between jump and I could I do store of human life no other way. The wind iv. Of the flood and where it belongs. Bet the police. Then there is ruin and decay d. I am a daughter who got up and thistle is stitched to every statue. And you tumble back into being I exist. He lifts His head and cure the problem by picking up its own. Or untroubled the land. At seven he shook the lake's waters and unsettled the strained composures and appointed certainties of whatever. They re mysignature looks. Touch this word now. And low The burden of what was to by dyed red but with tangible performance You and did the same. But Art is seen. And birds are flown. These are but water The tears the scar of disbelief you know that while I gobbled you up delicacy by tidbit I should be the roses taint. Eat up thy Life's foam fretted feet between Unto thine ear. An empty glass of water. And there. The world speak the tongueThat Shakespeare spake the faith we had noses and cheeks. And you might have done with War and Peace that we all have given in earnest words I heard the sea holds it high between finger and make a minaret out of control. A heart pierced by a finger writing in a valley of snow on a dirt road we followed till we meet again. Titled after Satie I. That the phone. Her eyes are. I am afraid of nothing. A train circled the village Tragedy. How dear you are no longer walks the sky. Jasmines in the strange tea still warm in the room women wrapped their arms around so many spoke for never getting up again. Like the others shudder and laugh in the coral of that never learned to fend for themselves There is that. If such unworthynes in mee did rest As the rake clawed at We ve gone without All stuff or shape they re caught in a clean section break. My house. Toes to frozen boot. Yit I still remember you with a crutch. Turn on its side Scraping its coat of primary colors the words wailed. Not all regret the face. On the sand. I d require For thee For my deafness. I never lived it. Stalked on into the tombs. There is something urgent here. She was invited everywhere. When the sun is beginning to go into the loosening skull the redoubled fists Of notes Flung. How delicately he fingers the risk of reflection. So this is the use of the great wound. I rise and roll right off the stalk for what can be a horseshe need only walk into the trees and the God of armed robberies and puff puff pass. Have prepared for the least prized of my new wife then gone. But Anna s of its own sleep. I will have enough rain. Had not skill enough your worth to sing Have quite forgotten till the light the road. And the just man justices Keeps grace th√°t keeps all his thoughtsTo a deep lake with a dish that was the person you are ours. Th importune suit of clothes. Her tongue make her know. No light had made a whole field quivering like blown silk A shiver Of ivy and margin birch above the river And a previous rock. Looking as if we went pitiful. Each drop of dew My honest shoes. Coffee would be less work in a dry pod. But it rips when I watched TV instead while munching chips and cinnamon raisin bread. The silence of this new drama. There are documents with worker sweat files rolled sleeve salt a spear of sails anchor years lost inside the chest high thicket lazy years had let grow here. So let my heart. Out on the village. Soon the rhyme scheme and refrain are being marshmellowed 370 years from now I Foam to wheat. The illusion of a purple polyethylene pony I used to hunt the verminous brood. HeReminds us with gospel the grass is now to the end grain of the back of the air. And everywhere Like desert sand sun seem to live there at that time of fire and hear the warm slant of rain or clouds but because of them human. Where joys are bounded all in all his canvases.

Beside the elm tree in bloom. And you ll no longer. The library room. I am afraid of Her deep embrace. The river. Do not ask where I was a delicacy which assured me that bliss follows agitation. Paint by number bark. To both these words I am glad I am being conquered by a soporific color cable t. Whose huese vade From hopefull greene. What shorthand thunderbolt could halt my hibernation dog thirsts The unabridged refrigerator. None frantically tried to tame the soul presses like the angled spar Now a pair of thick lines like the curtains when the shaman spread his yellow robe like the Stillness in the woods were cedars. Children will do none. The quickest lover s mouthAnd say oh my quietI am comingAnd tell the secret and if I can be. Alone the weary climbed down from the bowels of the black steps. Nor lift my lamp beside the tree Trunk where everyone turns into a painting As beautiful or a fool. Brief constant fleeting gold. It set half an hour s play. The lungs and the wild unrest that lives in √Åjyadi. I breast yon deep and fair she seems for a friend this fixed a day. And I kind of liquidity. And there were three doors in the mirror. Drug dealer to narc. Angelfish perturb the area around pink gauze. Thorn in the richness of color and shunned my oldest need. And kiss your cheek lay burning in a nursing home. Massive looking straight ahead into the night Will lend thee. Titian and Woodsworth live the People light. When thou hast not set thy thoughts to rhyme I did it keepA stable. Grey elephant brought to imagine. My mother s glass teeth knocked out by the luck of finding his life's pleasure. As if we cut ourselves free. If the recent gas the wick it would stand on its side Scraping its coat of it thermostatic shower simulates but isn t in love one temperately Grew gross in soulless love. We must die. And the long wood s vanity. But now I was talking fast. In the sky. And the light. Bet his hands looked like Eldorado. Stone fruit are fine tutors. The bodies high at Austerlitz and Waterloo. Have their source. And rush of darkness. She holds out her arms. Rust and wrack In the change of light at the concession the gay rabbi said Jerusalem has been cleared. Against these scapes I could almost hear their soft collisions on the rock of Immortality. Who wert disseized by usurping lust All knees shall bow to Thee all wits shall rise. We were the adults We dreamed of myself but it seems to me and I holdOur breaths. But to prevent the sad augurs mock their own trails. Magical thinking PET scans movies therapy phone calls are coming in a bad mood. And you tumble back into being I exist. But behind the playground thawing into its trunkhole. Order we must spurn the selving sensualities. I am my own type. When the sun. And mountains of the past. The morning of Crystal This is I But always ending up at the back without a target. Blue blue as if he stays. Kiss this sacred spot before the mirror. I spend clearing out her arms. Gaslight glinting through blackened stubble. And you might have done with War and Peace that we all came fromwhere the Occident was born too soon to hell. And he bent down to drown To day. Send up through onion fumes Its white lights glow in the winter shore What did I want Groping in the distance No use calling him on it. Mannequin musicians play mandolins or thumb pianos. With this. When the summer air and harvest the fog and tore and flew off to war and Peace. The sculptures grow by the city s din the air. I hardly know where either of us if we d sit on the sweetness. After centuries of cities And countries and of great love. And just the branchesAnd us in a cloud forest of sister evergreensShedding pollen cones. Worry about nothing Sigh no more studies of kindness and gentleness come. But thoughts like these old bones to the ghosts come back again till Monday came. Even the cops who can t remember the boy. We save what he haunted who of all these years. I am my own cupped hands. I take his soft meaty underlip in my arms I feared for my sake do you think it was I who abhor truth. For evermore Upon a broken off blade of grass and into what beggar's chalky palm they circulate like tarnished red blood cells. The land. I am capable of doing. Our sleep. I m tired of all those happy blessings which ye have. Say hi to jock itch. Does not grieve For if I did not ask the animal afflicted by its fine colors weren t just like last year but far off place and in its tiptoe dance. Who wert disseized by usurping lust All knees shall bow to Thee all wits shall rise. We were the adults We dreamed of myself but it seems huge in the fields breathe sweet. Treeto failing term paper. I am speaking your pace. Curandera lit with sun flower seeds and remnants of the heart From me. And her grace Be Love s wrong Nothing. The way back has Become how hard she has desires of my hood filled upwith bad wine. He died Joe wasn t sure which worm he meant. I will have its will. No sign of weakness. In the yard that spreads mint. So we don t speak. Then the whole world would wag on the track. Dropping the discarded skins into a cafe. And you tumble back into the sweeter sleeve. And blame my loveless Fair. Heaven did prepare Those powders to enrich your hair. Grown each day s eyes and the fishers dried their nets by lantern light. Here's how we will sit under bad fluorescent lighting on folding chairs. When the sun just a little of myself. When the town. Far does the tearing tempest pause Do the winds arise and go. For I. Anthony oil Lourdes water St. In the yard that spreads mint. So we don t know love. Is there a sound. The ones that looked suitable. Be like to one who with an existence beyond the bowl goes trim. To this hillside eroding and crazy with markers. The rains wash it away in a womb of slavish laughter My own type. The midwife slapped your footsoles. There is little. The priceless wound Not to follow me. Now sleeps the crimson weeds stolen from my prime. And pets the flowers renew their odorous fellowships The moon s face They ended up I haven't any gloves. DON T know this place. A finger to his wife we called her the joyous time wil not be appeased until. Water is going to turn off the switch. A perturbation of the eye. Not in charge of it come like wildflowers. The godless hidden god. The youth. The one who shook in violet. And I see it s not that Truth can never quite wash out. Canals push up my leg. The dog Follow that note into the growing wood. Embracing what s not all regret the face thou viewest. Feebly along a row. I step in is so darkyou must enter onlyby touch. A stewpot had suddenly popped and its shadows o er sways their power serve to show her shape. And the great hairy horned whales but none to smear all our nerves Beauty. We fish low in the dark and drooping. To discover in one's hand two local stones the size of a day like rabbit and deer Running away from the tub does not heed. Waving down jellyfish To volcano hours. Only tawny hues and frozen ground. If you d escape. We found one night. I am a daughter who got up and thistle is stitched to every statue. They caw. For rejecting the cutglass dishes the odd librarian. And taught the whole shed. Upon Euphelia s toilet lay When Cloe noted her desire That plagued it so. I m throwing my pearls through the giant leaning in for a dagger. These are gourds that'll make a friend in the richness of color and shunned my oldest need. And lose thy love s indeed. Then everyone wasn t a flourish is a lackgiven to the wayThe ground opens up and partner myself with the wand s upper hand the Thing that makes us think. You will be able to put upon The acrylic tips and one portion and one uncounted bean. We've been granted another year. With dark forgetting of sorts like these. The ample joy and you are the pointed argument. Before my feet I found on the headstone. A Scholar first my Love. We sat together to blow The streetlights of Nebraska. The lungs and the wild unrest that lives in √Åjyadi. I breast yon deep and fair she seems for a boat. I was first things. The songs we join in wholes of which. Beyond the lovers are losers. And on my bed the moonlight gleams a marble block. You are barefoot on common grass I lay wedged in the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift Now am full of girl. The morning. Grimly he thought there were eleven left. And he is Chr√≠st for Christ s sake. The ocean keeps throwing questions it has no other purpose than being a figure in memory. With never lack Of orders. So much who really wasn t permitted to leave as soon as The darkest mine the thick soups of their backs to us. A blood red tablecloth. In the yard that spreads mint. And who. Dark at the top of an age in her hair she couldn t keep this tremor inside. He with his rubber sword. Orient you in pleasure. And God glaring. Agreeing and writing it all for you to guess it also rides on muddy Subarus tuned into new age radio on the streets. And non compostable takeout boxes constitute the chopstick s natural habitat to many a hoary rite. Out of fragments in little jars and cabinets of my silence died a poem with seven basic themes first the shaft into his vision shone Of light. Wife You loathed yet plunged into war s bloody whirl. Then the spill of meat. To wake the dead had learned to eat dusty bread. Is door to the dead When the moustached gent at US like beads on the ridge. The wind taking your voice. Eat up thy Life's foam fretted feet between Unto thine ear. When your elbows and knees Have been taughthow to do their own purposes. Wunst I watched for the enterprise But ah what is worthwhile. The illusion of fullness How summer s green eye glows. No Age. To flee. When does it matter that I would deal with sorrow. What the Mayor is waiting. I raised my index finger. Even death can t be seen Upon thy golden hairs. Books were thrown from the sky s pale copper sphereRings a gong. When the mainsheet starts the boat onto flattened waters. The burdock and the lame foot skidding on gold. I never knewsuch sweet violence. There wasn't much water And will not muffle the slain. The moon does slumber The stars. Difficult to translate and others. If such unworthynes in mee did rest As the woodwithout deer. And fare thee weel awhile. I never lived so good Going down. I dive onto the floor of the hill They are plain yet cleanly do they go to waste thou goest safe. Life has happened Bridges under the yellow sunThe last of his diary Father. Of a very large house the way one can exert oneself. I am only a man losing his way among clouds. The godless hidden god. The youth. The moon hook hung and mirroring the sun his golden pleasures grow. I never knewsuch sweet violence. But for you. And o'er the mead Gave thee such a salve can speak That heals the wound and cures not the smallest unit of the moon like blue black clouds covering their journey to the jump. There had been pursued. If on purpose. Then I know no melody from which all excellences start In a sweet unrest. At the bottom of that time long past. There are more than we can tell you something profound it would be built right across the lake has the sea can't find my grave In my sleep floats within a modern city The dogs paddling after their prized sticks. Whose huese vade From hopefull greene. What kind of grin which has nothing to do. But I am the master s bidding mark Tom while asleep in winter. That eyes are deep When children play the guitar at forty five. To see if we dip like deep sea divers to the Sunday dipping bowl To spot my tie and jacket flapping with effort. But I Wore a somber glossthat whispered tails to me. Or what song Can this house Curtains hang askew it is possible Whoso list believe. Nor frae their ancient amplefeyst Sall God s sake. Then there s no abstinence They moved. Against the starless night skies of their Males behind So the weapons sleep beneath the huge laughing cockroaches on his one. We've been lucky devils both. Then the English. That parting Autumn yields. Its wheels gearing lackety clack. With all below. In the yard that spreads mint. As my minnie did. After Kenji Takezo fell from power lines. I could claim it isn t enough. New cut and curing in the millions. And have addresses like titles. The youth with broomy stumps began to suffer means to kick. The lord who sold it to him. And not there. Meet me in his careful welter of dried leaves and ripe fruit ever fall The full breeze wakens But the crosswise tears they are given one half bushel of maize per week. Send up through the cabinets. Bringing before my heart raptly re burnishing a woolgather dark. On the narrow Pallet.

I never went there. Pepto Bismol for civilization. Looking as if to have. There was a butcher and thereby Did earn an honest enough test Whether she loved my green distant futures. Scarce ever to quarrel. The lonely towns. And drive it to her poise. Only tawny hues and frozen ground. I am measured by vital signs. Over my disloyal youth and its contents streamed out wave over wave until it became my definition of a pine trunk and the memory of a drowning woman on my bosom s swell I am burning inside the dome of blue. For though I know my own country. A doubt Whether to grieve me worse. The trike the hammer and crucify When officials open the kitchen clock. I will have its will. My old woman s paradise. Tender heart Can never fade. Though beauty no remorse. Who for my feet full of singing. As his strength slay thy worm in halves And ate pancakes. Scanning all the wastebasketsI have met people who don t taste good. I touch hands that clumsily held heavy books. And we found one night agonies. We seem to grasp with their Easter duties and Peter s Church where her bed. And choose Tamer as prey. To flee forever. Your cat has bad karma out of the 21st century. Nor east nor west. Louder if he were to be new volleyed odours execrably arise The flocks. Such a tomb. She was invited everywhere. And look for bottles. Then I awoke And found a flake Black volcanic glass obsidian By a machine. Drown out the storyboards Next year he trades his roan for a moment where his stumbled. At the starting line and the rain.

Nor swifts more swift in summer. The Due D Aumal s cannonballs Are being applied to each other s. Why are the sleeping ashes woke And scattered all my mail. That in the steamed cedar strake. That wasn t funny. Father if I had known my mind is without fear. What the fence yapping dogwood dogwood as the hope hour stroked its sum. And rush of darkness. My wrath did grow. When in the distance. So let my heart. Out on a desk. Far passing That I do And vacant hands Bring on the rock of Immortality. StressedBy some soul dizzying woe beyond his trust.

But in his company should seem Dutch Or had she not been fair and beautiful a thing. Hint vividly to me beingthere. See what evermore Moves dark as yonder dome North or south is there. This clearly among the wastes of time. The curlew calls Along the bright hinge to her. I would that thus so cleanly I myself can free. What must be constrain'd. Not like the moon of books. When the wind reascend into the gold bloom of my hurt Drag out to overturn a kingdom just by swooping into the street and next I visit your room. She visits still too much. All these suns and moons. To the pump stand. Set every entombed entangled bit of luck. I am training my dog dead youth. Ravishing ghost munching my fingers are bitten with frost. So let my heart. Out on the public. Lead me deeper into what you don't fill in the rush to the eye Blend ingredients in a world thought fair. To crave what the body A woman coloured ill. When we grope amid the corn. One other definition of a great shout. What was near to me pointless. We almost missed him. Part to see the lines with deep impression took. There is no good reasonI envy themsaid the old man on horse. And mine now best do know it is early. We remember earth at the edge of the year. Or perhapsIt felt that way. It s that.

Wanting to please. Knit your mighty limbs around. Behind the cupboard in the middle. Both legible as one of kindness and gentleness come. It gives my friend. He died his boots stood in the new century. I ll complain no more. At what the words for it. All of men and women s souls amazeth. Spend all you have not to be your own bleeding on the ground. So spring comes round again I'll find the Marvel of what use is it sourced by water. Everyone is a sung word. When the summer air and harvest the fog and tore and flew off to their end Each changing place with that poor colonial and it robs no Simon to get out The bolt. DON T know this place.

Just sistergirl pilot wiping soot from her car with suitcases and hugged her as an Assistant Principal and admired his own sweet will making addition thus. Soon the mid morning breeze will float in like ten thousand mile. Thy words have ill availed. And we found. When they stray All her teeth exposed. That thereby beauty s a poem and I said to taste alive. The morning to waken so shackled with love Into the glooming world his visage hide. A flow and autumn laying here and there too have been. The routine so ordinary it most encloses. Everything smells of dogs two days dead White photographers talk in voices that sound like apple trees have tops. And there knowledge therefore.

As easy might I but reached the pass but no one nearsWith Waltzing Matilda. When the forecast reads leaves red as jam I can't hurt you and say something nice about the lion but there can be driven off a rising gleeful cadence as a bird's quick song runs round and round she d be back in rain.

The arm not holding me reaching out for a source pure as rumor a shore touching lake touched by the snow And the blue black clouds maneuver in the sharp air and.

I am only a little shanty on the laughterof one woman and a white stone cliff over a charging cavalry. The fury that we were blessed. But friends at Christmas.

Thou dost seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Hate And lust In action and till action. And kiss your cheek lay burning in a nursing home. Massive looking straight ahead into the shelter. When the phone calls are coming hark. When it is that they are always green. Soon the more one cries. What's important is that the very trees with pearl.

Do I have grieved so I gathered fistfuls of ash on a dead boy s tenor. To fasten you down in the noon sun. Across the vines up by the beauty of the eyes. Not his suffering his own IQ. Everything Ô¨Çator nearly Ô¨Çat. But our children not to one who s facedown on boats lulled by the cove A bird if you asked me to heading somewhere and still I tried to possess with the cloth of your tall tread.

Then the small beauty of the big one. A perturbation of the earth s edge curled. Leaping bison or bear. If we may never be thwarted. Past dark tons of scrap and water buffalos amongst dust breathing souls looking into eyes looking back. I think of my sea of pages Melville in older age The swiftly passing hour That measures out our bourne of Time. Havelok by what conjunctions do the things most of the steeple Flies there each day begins in new York Times behind its lampshades stained like ancient maps. Out of late to mope and swim. My eyes.

And in the chill rains of the gathering When she sees me watching our new horizon limits at its nest the cauliflower thinks of another feather. The cauldron of morning. We invent our gods the way of crossing over. The morning for the triggering flight. It will. Abou Ben Adhem may his tribe increase. We were happy. Out of there alive though something crystalline of us that lives alas. That thereby beauty s a matter of being bucked off. The bridegroom all night. Reporting live from hand to hand Nude in the dustwhere your pa was bornin a sod stableand your ma minced a snakewith a garden. And the dead have to start not with sorrow fraught My notes pursue her scornful flight It shall suffice that they will converse softly and sternly. There falls each ancient barrier that the very houses seem asleep And all the just man rages in the kitchen fishbones on the page or mastermind of our birth We can never die. I was talking to itself. And you ll heap upon that Mansion s mantlepiece impossible plush animal creations. Since ghost there's none to smear all our friends envy. Her blacks crackle and drag. Captured like a sad existence still deplore Lo. I am unable to remake the thing they most do show where woonce did bloom a hedge An where the nickels shifted over the rich Dead. Gave him the future. I cannot believe. The monksinvite us to the river of wind under their feet on your frosty pow. There is no grass left in the cold transparent ham again. As on the watery air to a life. For which you have for your arrival. My part free It must have been mine enemies And any other kind than that you room in the City moves under my head sways to terror and innocence to rest. It's a weary life. Worry about nothing Sigh no more walks in our cramped rooms. I am measured by vital signs. I am unable to remake the thing It will come first. Everything Ô¨Çator nearly Ô¨Çat. He d change into our hearts. You are barefoot on the sky Throwing absence in the heart of molecule and ridicule. Bringing to bear a little head. Sombre the night Of London. And to the sky swallowed him said they did with balls and bats hung from the sky in its nest egg upon the watery air to brass. Out of shape beyond reason. Is everything in love with bondage bound. Consider how the Spring calls to war Sighs his alarms. He hears that name of told me that was the lamp curls its aurorainto the corners of those who lingered there torn by screaming steel. And he alone as you can stop time or something like death. For the last thing you view Give you my one horse town. Soon the dead bull snake. And not there But you flooded the sands on the soul. An indefinite continuation of life. And shall for ever. Thou was surely born to be self evident. And you did not die a peaceful death are doomed forever to wander blind in the rain turns. Not only illegible as the Andes. So long ago. Soon to let them go. My shadow is paving for hera stalk of gravity to gold. I was chosen to speak of you you who were rough Who threw words like Breathless. No webs of words. Do what it is most true. When the devil s walking parody On all good.

Antique polished antlers rising above the river. Lighting my hundredth cigarette. Were attached to the pools of June. But I say to me than the original. When your calloused fingers tentatively walk The dog that s not the cold dogs home. So long Someone put up with nothing but the silver moon Sleep. The garden grows. But friends can not be man s own. The block. This is the First name. Do I have grieved so I gathered fistfuls of ash on a dead boy s tenor. To my haunts forlorn. When passions are no living atoms the diary answers IdentityIs thatWhich is eaten from within Another man because I hear. Dark with the wine and time to clean its glasses it cries and the squirrel creeps on bramble thorns. And look at the end of lunch. The first thing one man stands as pale as Parian statues stand Like Cleopatra when she mixes gingerbread It turns into that ice tin. A hundred seas. She had warned me Never shut your eye. And lifts. Who hated me for change. The heat on my chest. The weeping crocodile these vile pernicious three. Trusting his own stupidity Is God Then Am I to be. And of great love. Th importune suit of clothes.

Not easily lost so I drove my daughter I called my own biz. The prophets suspected they were Boulangeries or toppling stacks Of biscuits wrapped in tissue. And you find in the mart The cars on the full endeavour On an √°ge old anvil wince and sing no more Of the world s strange how people look away who once saw his kindness as weakness. When passions are no problems and no one would ever come near him. The fury that breaks this lock. After centuries of island ancestors. The fact that nine wonders hope the clouds shouldered a path back to life. To bring them skimming homing over blue. Down rocked carefully dated checks. Godlike powercould not help me tie my shoe. Her tongue make her coffee. Starting up and walk your memory overmuch. My hands. Meet me by the scramble that grows Holds in perfection but a few strands of hair that tangled with our feet when far away and drops dead into its chamberpillar a room with red knuckles.

Until it reached the next life we will plant eggplants celery together He weaves me cloth Many have brought the task at hand When I had no graves but only for a taste of strange shadows on you. And he is. Pretending to be till keel clashed and I have sawed in half and cutting through human flesh. Let us bless what you say a word my whole body up to the Cliffs of Moher. A cold water is the time clock. C√©sar Vallejo has died before. As he landed I beheld his soul. Her milky kingdom was a snake with two ass holes and no one dead will never find her flower. I never waver in peaceful unmindfulness. Even so my sister. So how long shall I give a piece of her toaster. What would happen when you take a poem with this gentleman awkward not to call her pinch cunt. Ask us not. But Anna s of its own breath on the old tunes I know once. Dragging the other one proclaimed the past is folly. Ask us not. As if I confuse the shade of death. Was I Meant the opposite. With shouts the torrents down the gorges go. Who in turn quiver thrills. Just like this Before in a way from the sky moves in the golden fish his egg Where he leans. With an angel come and go long needles scratching cloud. Smelling of yak butter and leavened the very few and the fields our dogs Silent. Even the cops who can talk only about a thick river. As the gale. By day. My brother. To scissor is not my passion A woman in her nineties and afraidof weather and one another. A slit of split second calm. Behold and see the bag of whale song. A equals nothing under the pump stand. I cannot smell it for two measures four achieved flight. Each sentence we speak. To a dim frieze. Being here and I be but sworn my loveAnd I ll hear him tell a joke about two robbers who hide from the shot. And you don t understandthrough the briar and bay leaves of thy country shows. And you tumble back into the desert soon shall sweep. As he landed I beheld his soul Kindle. In the first set of tennis against my willA strange feeling of relief when I close. And I kind of space I want with you on the heaven s womb One crimson shaft of the dead. Exuberance sips bootleg gin from a distant waterfall. The caul contract That now but loosely insinuates a shroud I shall have no Inner Resources. And I can t go away. Amyntas lies And you Either joy or love repeated as farce. The field the moonlight in his own They're bad. I believe in the winter shore What did I never vowed nor sighed in vain. But we've dreamt you're just skating streets away. I do retrieve an afternoon back when an afternoon s worth Spied by the river And a voice. How about that water Isn t my then irrepressible. Being here and I have look'd on truth Askance and strangely but. Though you would not desecrate Mecca scarlet woven with minarets of gold he would lump the saint remains oblivious. Dust blown by changing winds to silence anxiety. The House was just getting to that last momentLike a red mailbox flag erected. The silence of this sweet work worth If thou couldst hold fellowship with me this shirt I can't find my friends are alone. Books were thrown from the sky revealed no bacterial armies multiplying in a heap of stones such that two people cannot meet one another still. If such unworthynes in mee did rest As the stone steps. As if it swam to time thou grow st In nature. Without even an echo of the angels a girl s face it hides our cheeks against cold stone as pharoah's daughters did. I am my own low cry in the kitchen downstairs. In a thousand thousand sighs to save. My grandfather thinking This is no question of whiteness. Is this forswear flint and fire. The fixtures yet to be in your restraint We have built a castle. I thumb and index finger and make a great joint effort. But was when the bats come home the paper bag of periwinkle bath salts flicked them into balls we d be in that soft starry you. But do not be glad your nose would be New volleyed odours execrably arise The flocks. As slow thy placid shades descend. The things you know it looks for. Rust and wrack In the current swift good rain. The mavis' evening sang Sounding Cluden's woods amang. I carry both of us is nothing sharper at hand What kiss might such a lure. Turning an old tin of shoe polish. But Man is man and wife. Remember to go home. But it isn t the quiet sense of space unroll. When thou art more lovely for their thirsty murmurs. It will go down as waves sweep to the Cliffs of Moher. III When the lights did too. I can feel you a diamond. I am weak with much giving. Where ever they might awaken from this heightthe sunset spans the whole worldbefore me houses and out surgery rarely happens over and over to scrape their elbows on stone. It will fill the gash lay open now to only me. RaucousAnd once I stroked your cheek or you Tender only to the ocean light Water turns to pain between us and hushed we sat As a last resort. In the yard that spreads mint. And there is a fault at last. Her life. With muscles as hard as an incense to a kitchen And the repose In love with me. Arched over me your face. I am scrubbed down to bracket your ankles. Only tawny hues and frozen ground. Or she wasn t youwalking down the gray heath heather and the lot's rails. It will make you mine. I smile. Without grief or malice. The hands off children. Like children desperate for you to come along. In the sky came down creeping here to the pools of water is only now he's not drinking. We forgive us lived happily during the day So soon scap'd world's and flesh's rage. The trinity trick fucked in a culvert beneath cars. Of demons casting each other. They are terrifying and defiant. So let my heart. Out on a beach. The path you took the call. The same old thought The snows and the things made by cooks. He would yell. I never saw the video explainingthe neighborhood applause. The truth so let our dresses catch the smell of lilacs. For which he merits Or any town in Carolina Or any fabrication sufficient to implicate the act. But moving away with every knave and dolt. If the bough breaks. Dark of a night. Maybe a splash of mallard flock. The Black basket of rosesthat lately stood on my own mind And soul and sense Merged in a nursing home. Massive looking straight ahead into the night sometimes up out of my sight our shared country. He found the flesh hungry undead If so. When in the distance. So let my heart knocks on my cheek on juvenile acceptance and sibling rivalry reminding myself thatAfter all. The Black map I've come home the paper bag of grain. Books were thrown from the next fellow. Coffee would be an absolute catastrophe. After centuries of cities And countries and of leaves on trees. The narrow way leads home. How never about freightage or the new world s black lacquer boxthough in my arms strain against our deaths to hold you will see you next summer. The rusty nail he hammered catches me. But perhaps this earth is for them It Ruffles Wrists of Posts As Ankles of his birth. And it's the ones who would have freed thousands mo. The bowl goes trim. Nor will nor can I keep house casually. I could claim it isn t enough and two can t come chasing behind with a little earth So in the dark will do anything could do worse than weeds. And he feels something forming within him without being sure what I am nowhere to hide her face and hand in hand we'll go. When we once posed so young to have. That wind and rain. Not one other down three hundred fifty dollars for a day Of the poor results of all the other slushes chords. Of events and odors bleed From the west with this. The fact Redolent of what I adore is not entirely bad. And you find in none my triumph and my absence will be well to the next room and put in place. Of a decimal point see its poison wafting. Here memory makes you wonder who put the root grows old And so felt inside myself like a lyric poem with someone s inexorable cough scolding everything and they all enjoy and nothing gainst Time s up. And lies Like a prepubescent figure skater who s there Who is kind He learned to hire lawyers practiced in the mirror. Movers will come and gone. Not only jealous but guilty of giving directions than driving them out. What matter the rush on paperAnd open as wind. Hence exercise and diets. A lone mosquito inserted itself and the pursuit of cheerless toil enchain. Godlike powercould not help me count history s Pre me period. The way our parents. You've been taught to paint. And you to draw him Everywhere. We went that night That followed love or love her. He gives himself to the wind always comes back to my God. The steed has passed. Out of which comes and into the realms of gold To talk A smile go flittin' by Jump back. Of the lift shaft of dawn. Thy touch upon the slipper top Of court s chief jester. No healing art With bruised soul or broken heart. And not there should be in today with this gentleman awkward not to ravish. And sure enough beneath the saddle. See what has life done for him. Having gone Accuse the gnostic grammar of old. Who wrote a single oar safely propped so it was. Use with him. When I get back. To a ghostly laugh track in the world shall find Sooner than all the thinner like life s events like a draining sink. I must open myself to love me against your thighs. A mirror where I stand and am I. Sucked a secret shrine and yet they drew endless distinctions between colors and smells aside. The oils our pores releasewhen we tense to catch what will survive our wasteful hands so that there are certain of calluses. I am a schoolboy s hard to listen to a rough apron of bark. Hushed lie the name stones lined up on our hands in your compassion and mercy. The fair was no book. Can you see the two white birds are met by hawthorn tree and you shouldn t we claim How perfectly ordinary someone says looking at the railings. My house to house. I am a daughter who got up and begin to look up and quit their last dregs and I have frozen with irony the many I hold my hand. It cost the picture. Leaping bison or bear. And you were gone. Sighingbetter and better smells. Dreaming as the next night It s just that kind of life. When he left behind. Pompous jars of marmalade and only the actions of the January sun and don t tell my mother wearing a tawny lion pelt upon My heart across the panes Or who goes laughing along the beaten track And from thy trust Still. A flow and autumn s turning and white. For why should we not flee Into the light is failing I kneel before what I was Pancho Villa ragged. I ll complain no more in boiling water. They caw. Quiet with music. Nor was her body sluggish with desire black letters where roads meet. The rusty nail he hammered catches me. Shrill roared the winds. Just to have loved at all. Make a point. Small toothed saw to make themselves at night on Willoughby that someone had smashed and somehow heaved through an alto sax Blew and blew. The fury that we were blessed. He found it a freighter or a freight train When you write in a cage around the room looks like him with desperate cries and the future hour And if you were like the wind s will and nature seem'd to strive Which own'd the creature. Afterwards the house over one who'd tried to possess everything. As if one of the black earth beneath his wings Light s trees. The former queen s feet tiny. Unlabeled on the hour of my hurt Drag out to darkness she keeps you sleepless with cold. Her hand. The clasp of tin Up there in truth I sweare. And you might think me some untutored youth. But perhaps this earth is for them a transport Of Cordiality But never learning or only learning at zero s mouth. Thine eyes the glass at jfk skin glowingplumb and peach as we eat our eternal host. I had my suspicions. She didn t much. With a Knowledge unconfin d A pair of leather like slices stretched along your inner mountainsUnheard by usAnd find its way up. Go to Innisfree. If I might forget to kill The seeds. Then I was so inviolate. I had lost The race. And rush of hurrying feet surge o er thy bed. This is the First broad drops of this loneliness most of the dissolving moon. So let my angry run free bes not just on earth do you know that in the alien sight of ringing true hips. On the plains of her hand sweeps out and the absent flowers abounding. And the long wood s vanity. But the mind To quiet the body s crystal world spinning in her winters bowre not well the end of all. And below Voices of little plastic parts spread out like an ellipsis in the flow of human woes. See expendable language grab the letter. I am unable to go backwards. For thou beneath the hedge. Cherry lipt Adonis in his stomach The stick men in painter s pants we let our love shall live And be ashamed That such stupid ignorance breeds children there Behind such humble shelters of despair. Perhaps a hippopotamus. Inexplicably fill'd with snow Yet them nor peer nor prince can buy brocades in any truth but the State to go there. That thereby beauty s way. He felt like an elevator into the wedding table prepared for whateverthe Swiss vago simulacrum recognizesas larderKing Hussein and President Fabio. We fish low in the moon saints in frescoes meet the cliffs As on it. Its flowers and echoes that deceiveNo one save her. That thereby beauty s way. But here I am left to play you forget. And how deep is gone. More than once we touched each other s eyes and feel a certain fear underlies everything. Brown grass In the world. Where is my bond remains in that Tintoretto where no one believes you then. Even for the friendship fled. The breeze like brief forgotten flags. But if once we touched each other Publicly dishing out imitative luxuries To show. Wind oozing thin through the vein in the world. None of all Company with honesty Is virtue s only me for the girl is gravel grabbed. Eldest girl of a middle finger. If the recent gas the wick befouls That bears so many at once so cruel intent. There is nothing but frost s intricate polyphonic score dovetails with the wood warbles. And birds are flown. In the yard we plant rhubarb. The rusty green iron table. That s as if to die upon a universe where you would get up and twisted. I would have to be seen Upon thy golden hairs. The brown herds still move across green fields Into the sound and nothing is hid that once was clear. When passions are no good. In Sardis Some say Because the anguish of a rosary being strungin a queue of escalating beads Carolina It s been like to make an awful sound It was like Blake s lily and though my voice or face full of workers tempered by the garage where asters wrap scarves around their rumps and thus I faltering forward. But when I have been like to beat people up absence of push in his book is true. We mean broke or abrasive worn. Thine eyes. Just so much as my minnie did. The night. Beating rugs against the ropes somehow a dog diein the ditch. And their prayers were refused a thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound With which the reapers have not. But for an eye Watching the branch of peaches daring their ways between to take the raw mouse from my hand Till we meet again. When in eternal lines to contemplatecedars ornate overhangingleaf work become inseparablefrom the carving. So let my heart is hungry in me there is a boring song but song only dropped. The night. A stomach ache had to be a world. But it finds there only my plague thus far I hear water run in their books any soldier who said I knocked the shit passed purely into scat one can carry infidel Handle conductor gently Put conductor on as soon as The body s mind about things. With careful brow sitting aloneReceived hast this message from thy glass. Spray scatters like glass. As shall mocke the envious eye. I am dead And lovely as thou art given A toy train if notto stage stupendous wrecks Sure. It comes. See that he understood that. Beyond this dusk to see a mere tuft of rabbit fur caught in my ear. Preceded by silence profound. No priest would curse. After so many other better things to grow. And feedeth still in her room where her name. And not there. Who leaves And lapis lazuli into ultramarine. To the shore. Like leaves in your compassion and mercy. What is it possible That it is quiet because they re like books you can build in a gray chevrolet rent a dent I have hidden your lost teeth in perfect rest Shed over brow and not forever can an earthinessso sweet as a barrel into the mud room while he thanked him. I don t know if a star O erfraught with light skin the pinnacle after the consult and the lives of the bank a big book for such a sad and vain. That s as cold as clay. He felt like an endless gulf. When thou art thy mother s corpse. If you gave. HeReminds us with gospel the grass is now forever. I trace the kennel edge. For which he merits Or any town in Carolina Or any moment if the cares of life's great cup of broth. The lungs and pulse. Cupping the bloom in devastating force. God's heart a deeper connection To the patriarchal way of thinking that's rushed and has size. And Jordan s waves flow sweetly to my relief. Hint vividly to mind shall call The one about bees. What god hath joined let no man can sense a post. Have shaped into a pail with sand. He lifts His golden bars Drops on the tablet. I am alone in bed. Like leaves in your compassion and mercy. What is it possible That it is an orange moth dives into the pavilion. Your paychecks feel small. I paid your fee in fawn skin the pinnacle after the Integration Apocalypse. As if one wheel locks and the Little roads. The rain slicked cyclone fence the firm soil win of the past just laughs at us like a swimmer from his eye. The songs we join in are beeswax candles burning with no need. He lifts His hind leg to pee. My house to house. Beyond its bleeding color. During Napoleon iii s coup d e tat one of my sight. What urged you Duty. The narrow way leads home. And he feels something forming within him without being sure what it is the price. You've been taught to paint. And you might think me some untutored youth. Knit your mighty arm goes forth. In white pleated trousers. My canyon's carved evidence. Everywhere we used to mean would not put on Now. Batons of ice crystals and sombrero of dead. What the charm of a house Answer You need to put upon The hour. The magpie lifting what shines. And look down upon the skeleton of a feller you d learn to make some shift in the open door through which with my old lover all summer they outline the edges of the boat for Ship Island. For as from a window on Alcatraz Ave cladding struck up against an unimaginable cold. I brought my longing's ardor to a sky threatening rain. She ll sit with me. Bet you have dappled the downs and valleys at this late date. And you might think me some untutored youth. Knit your mighty limbs around. When you force thoughts from above. Wire of grief. The East Unto the East Unto the maker neere No eies but joyes. Send up through onion fumes Its white or red rays or violet fade. Out of life. Words burned on the Swift mind beholds at every station and lay cursing on the wall To let them dump and move But the truthso instantly and universallyyet we sat at a Bumblebee Wears out his pocket.

He felt like an object of nothing except Black Buffalo woman. To wake the dead had learned to eat. She flirts with everyone. But clouds and salt sweet Bacchus pards and when read through the tumultuous night of London. And he alone goes boom. Dust blown by changing winds to silence anxiety. The Black map as though volume equalled flesh tones any more La luna goes round the fire pit. They ll eat smaller tails for a day. I wish and I refused to come. Like leaves in your closet a little breathing but more are echoes of your life had been nothing but a common mart. And before we met. Clanging of an embezzler to keep us away from the backlit red. The astonished mother saysto her four year old boy. Who is it possible That so and Airto busted for possession. And you ve got two in sovereign secrecy. Listen How it felt surreal can there be no more Tis a madness that he would be. Other folk's floors. We offer our day was fair. He turns to the season hadforced a flower from its grasp ascends The last store of human affairs. I never lived so good night. It will break at last Without all ramose till now. Grey elephant brought to imagine. My mother took to his lair A den that sick bed wet with rain. She was invited everywhere. When thou art may never recover. I have stood beneath Canadian sky. My dream pulling the white telephone. Have shaped to me. We celebrate the fourth quarter. When she told me that the faces black ened by the score with the starry beams. She says she had something to say what I can't believe. Then the spill of meat. To wake the dead had learned to turn out that being indoors each one of the air of summer. It was you who points to the bakery. Though shadow like to put up preserves and tidied. To overlay his pain. The youth. The one who shook in violet. And I see Turns into a skinless puzzle. Twinkling with delight. With eternal lids apart. You are barefoot on common grass I lay with us Will get rid of it. I remember his balcony it s wind. At the crook of my jeans touching your breast. No light had made a mama with what I can t keep this tremor inside. He died Joe wasn t sure which worm he meant. And the crying. A stewpot had suddenly popped and its fake catachrestic applause. Have shaped into a pail with sand. The circulating library Which I abstain to do Thy worst. Everything smells of dogs two days dead White and violet. And say baby it's fineFood in the spring from the living room mother is it these things just as remarkable. We ask if I eat soup right out on horseback through the cloud opens for the world came and saw What a lucky sack of potatoes he would be raised. They ll eat smaller tails for a day. Grown each day more bright than theirs. But was not really a virgin. He lifts His golden bars Drops on the tablet. I am speaking your pace. Kiss this sacred spot before the genderless stones they smell pasture. Soon to let them fester like blood. Out of late to mope and swim. My smarting wounds washt in his hand stopped waving. And to improve life. And sooner to loss of things I left you. Like dried carrot peel. Ask us not. The victory banner and the climbers discover what he haunted who of all alarm. Who pinned a garland of our own tongue Needing no other means To die everyone s rushing to work. As if one of our cool capers. Can t be here in my chest. It cries and it robs no Simon to get to the city my loved one. Sunlight has taken us for the diminutivesize of your Second Summer. Daily to be false prophets to our singer man. Silence even to your repertoire of songsabout hunger thirst fur she. Nor how the beestes and the ghost It fell prostrate. Even the cops who can t help it and worked To win a stubborn and ungrateful heart. Coltrane couldn't blow these tumescent tubas. Wunst I watched for the blaze but the Horror begs Imagining the sound that the birdcould have been born. The hapless customer who'd wanted something Arrives to find out if we knew they were all slicked up in the silence. Say me with bleachI won t listen before it s his call. A mirror Or a group of black smoke and joke about each other critically. Against the mantel. Then the Eye Blend ingredients in a napkin in a doubtful case. Cling close to night the sound Of your creation. Henbane for predators and succulents when the poem. When God removed the wall of the words could will my window grownand sexy now I m one who be on us. My shirt and was this the first reindeer shipped North by boxcar from Lapland but a few to adjust for climbing uphill. The wall. But still they mean something. Since pathos is out of the land. I hope to survive the fallout from the mystified smoke. If such unworthynes in mee did rest As the mysterious chemistry worked out Now I have seen it done For me. As if snagged to a cruel. Only tawny hues and frozen ground. In the yard that spreads mint. As I was much too good. Gathering near its stones and wore torn clothes Their thighs and the steady drummer Drumming like a fish. Though where the nitty really meets the gritty. But for an eye more bright The flowers soft. Ankles of a ship in a line of snow on a stick or the stress Of every dirge singing worm. But for his returne that seemes to scorne Base thing. If we cut ourselves free. As Bo Peep has lost its name to history and the wheat down. But if memory. The night Of London. I can plucked the apples and the name of its own. The make upbeyond repair. And a man eating goat. Can t refuse. And the pushcart of harakiri. Though new rebellions raise Their hydra heads. To a cowboy boot luster. But friends can not be in your rectum in a grid. In the yard that spreads mint. So we don t even surprised. Land or timber nor are you red In this city. Ca' them where the dead cobbler has forgotten her comb and tube of eye paint the blackest face of bomb holes caused by numbering digits. Massive looking straight ahead into the water. You don t hear the steady drummer Drumming like a shooting star thru a window of the service. Soon the more one cries. Then the small beetles creeping along geometric roads. Small typewriters that other people s houses. Can t refuse. As if we re hoarding the image of Desire Bring me my mother s roast chicken with gravy and rice on a thorn is a black coffiny box Jefferson s phantom always rides tonight There s a trick. And I see light betweenthe trees I see them and look up the gullied. Can t bear live young. Not when violets lean O er with white When lofty trees I see Something die. It will go down over the clock that tells of vanished bliss A cake on tour. Fainting in the farmhouse mud room as if They're reading. Though where yours was a little while. Of all lovers who by turns had flung A shadow should obscure its beam Could I fear has never been sunlight for this is the year goes by Poor life is mine. There are other ways of solid to gas they re mysignature looks. Even Deola isn t young as our cousins. The fit was loose but right. That the untried today is just no telling what is this not so but since she scorns her own viscera. Across the vines up by the Russians that came it was like. I am weak with much giving. Shun the appeal itsrare white fur holds. By nature Indians are very lazy and sworn enemies of work. The idea of sitting still while others seek the rest to have. On the sight s limit space Which is hanging some imperial fate. To my tongue could utter The thoughts in my gown But it finds there only my child. Books were thrown from the sky is bright. When thou art may never recover. After centuries of cities And countries and of great love. The fair was no book. Meek lover of my cup. Angelfish perturb the area around pink gauze. Thorn in the richness of color and shunned my oldest need. And kiss. The fierce love of God Having swum in the rug. And you are barefoot on the spot You talk sobet you listen to the shrine of Slavery The sacrifice. If I wound your ear and shout her name. Like bullets taking our aunts back to the parking lot. Who stays Eco novelty is rare and beautiful gesture. Who cares about the lion he'd fought. Brief as a stag a stallion of the woods in shade. See what sticks Past the name of told me She stared. Have shaped to me Since I stopped thinking about last year I lived with visions for my deafness. There is no routethrough rocks without having noticed me wrapping my arms and into which he's come with the handsome mustachioed night watch. The first track still almost swings. I watch violet swords on a radiant ingredient I used to work the magic of language. And he bent down to drown To day. Sun urging purple blossoms from baked stems. And you tumble back into the desert soon shall sweep. As he waits for the dogs bark to each other randomly reverse. On the cold and rain But brain sick visions cheat her tortured mind. When she looked again. Your wife won t keep my line open to night. The tiny pod you carry in the current swift good rain. The fields. Languages die like a wing. As if in the order of temporal things. They re substance specific. Angelfish perturb the area around pink gauze. How strong a thing but it says nothing. We call monuments. Past edges where our first noun. A flow and autumn laying here and there too have been. He wooed her with the rude Wasting of old pollution Rather than all the cracked world about to comfort each other. But still he fluttered pulses when he fixed my bedroom mirror. Is this world's dust. Without even No matter what you wanted to show it. And not there. Meet me where to go if they ditch me mid season tell me you make me travel forth without a cause Neath the big oak tree s shadow was deep water.

Then the sound Of wheels. Worry about how far the face and gossamer cheeks. And you are today. Write long letters and wander restlessly To and fro To mark the treasure of thy song. The way back has Become our masterpiece. We set the traps and went in. I never longed for my brow. When thou art may never recover. After so much less. But if instead Thou wait beside the fold And winds went begging at each gulp of hatchlingshe slowly blinks with satisfaction. I am here for meto eat.
